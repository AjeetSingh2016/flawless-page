Today state is the source of wealth. In the modern era of a welfare state, government’s economic activities are expanding and the government is increasingly assuming the role of the dispenser of a large number of benefits.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Position in Britain</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">At Common Law, before 1947, the Crown could not be sued in a Court on a contract. This privilege was traceable to the days of feudalism when a lord could not be sued in his own courts. Another maxim which was pressed into service was that the King can do no wrong. <b>The Crown Proceedings Act, 1947</b>, abolished this procedure and permitted suits being brought against the Crown in the ordinary courts to enforce contractual liability, a few types of contracts being, however, excepted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Position in United States of America</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In the United States, the principle of immunity of the State as a sovereign power was imported from England. This led the Congress to enact the <b>Federal Tort Claims Act, 1946</b>, to abrogate, largely, the immunity of the Federal Government from Tortious liability, subject to specified exceptions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Position in Australia</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The <b>Judiciary Act, 1963 </b>lays down the law relating to government liability. In the case of <b>Sargood Bros. v. Commonwealth </b>it was held that an action lies against the Commonwealth in contract or tort, in the ordinary manner, by a subject or a state. Similarly, in the case of <b>Commonwealth v. New South Wales</b>, it was held that a State may be sued in contract or in tort without its consent.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Position in India</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The words &#39;had not this Constitution been enacted&#39; in <b>Article 300(1) </b>indicate that the basis of sueability of the state in India is historical. In order to appreciate the significance of these words, we must trace the history of the Indian Administration from the time of the East India Company, when the Court was of the view that even though the East India Company has sovereign powers, if it contracts in civil capacity and if it breaks its contract it would be held answerable. Later the Government of India Acts (Section 30 of Act of 1915 and Section 175 of Act of 1935) expressly empowered the Government to enter into contracts with private individuals and the corresponding provision in the Constitution is <b>Article 299(1). </b>In all these Acts it was provided that the person making the contract on behalf of the Government would not be personally liable in respect thereof.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The <b>Indian Contract Act, 1872 </b>does not prescribe any form for entering into contracts. A contract may be oral or in writing. It may be expressed or be implied from the circumstances of the case and the conduct of the parties. But the position is different in respect of Government Contracts. A contract entered into by or with the Central or State Government has to fulfill certain formalities as prescribed by <b>Article 299 </b>of the Indian Constitution. In the case of <b>State of Bihar v. Majeed</b>, the Hon&#39;ble Supreme Court held that :</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: center;">&quot;It may be noted that like other contracts, a Government Contract is also governed by the Indian Contract Act, yet it is distinct a thing apart. In addition to the requirements of the Indian Contract Act such as offer, acceptance and consideration, a Government Contract has to comply with the provisions of Article 299. Thus subject to the formalities prescribed by Article 299 the contractual liability of the Central or State Government is same as that of any individual under the ordinary law of contract.&quot;.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Though there is hardly any distinction between a contract between private parties and Government contract so far as enforceability and interpretation are concerned, yet, some special privileges are accorded to the Government in the shape of special treatment under statutes of limitation <b>(See Navrattanmal v. State of Rajasthan, 1961).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 299(1) of the Constitution lays down three conditions which the contracts made in the exercise of the executive power of the Centre or a State must fulfil to be valid:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These conditions are:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="(1)"><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Such contracts must be expressed to be made by the President/ Governor as the case may be;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(2)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Such contracts made in exercise of the executive power are to be executed on behalf of the President/Governor as the case may be; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(3)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">The contracts are to be ‘executed’ by such persons and in such manner as the</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">President/Governor may direct or authorise.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(4)"><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The word executed in Art. 299(1) indicates that the contract between the government and any person must be in writing. A mere oral contract is not sufficient for the purposes of Art. 299(1).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Now the Contention arises whether contract is valid if prerequisites not followed by<span class="h1"> </span>government</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The terms of the Article have therefore been held to be mandatory and not merely directory. This means that a contract not couched in the particular form stipulated by Article 299(1) cannot be enforced at the instance of any of the contracting parties.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">But in <b>Mulamchand v. State of Madhya Pradesh </b>But, then, the courts have also realised that insistence on too rigid observance of all the conditions stipulated in Art. 299 may not always be practicable. Hundreds of government officers daily enter into a variety of contracts, often of a petty nature, with private parties. At times, contracts are entered into through correspondence or even orally. It would be extremely inconvenient from an administrative point of view if it were insisted that each and every contract must be effected by a ponderous legal document couched in a particular form.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The judicial attitude to Art. 299 has sought to balance two motivations:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="(i)"><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">on the one hand, to protect the Government from unauthorised contracts; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(ii)"><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">on the other hand, to safeguard the interests of unsuspecting and unwary parties who enter into contracts with government officials without fulfilling all the formalities laid down in the Constitution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Application of estoppel</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">No estoppel can apply against the government if it seeks to nullify a contract which is not in the form as prescribed by Art. 299. “There is no question of estoppel or ratification in such a case”. <b>(Mulamchand v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 1968) </b>Therefore, Art. 299(1) cannot be bypassed by invoking the doctrine of estoppel. Estoppel can be applied in certain cicumstances where contract made by Statutories bodies but not under 299(1) <b>(see Gujarat State Financial Corp. v. Lotus Hotels Pvt. Ltd., 1983).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 112 of the Limitation Act, 1963 <span class="p">contains provision for longer period of limitation of suits on or behalf of the State. The longer limitation period was based on the common law maxim nulla tempus occurit regi i.e. no time affects the Crown. Some privileges are also accorded to Government in respect of its ability to impose liabilities with preliminary</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">recourse to the courts. This probably is because of doctrines of executive necessity and public interest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Note- <span class="p">The issue in Administrative Law mainly arises where the Departmental Authorities and public officials, owing to their inertia or ignorance, enter into informal contracts which do not comply with the requirements of Article 299(1). There has been a plethora of cases on this point, yet the law is still not well settled.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The general law of contract is based on the conception, which the parties have, by an agreement, created legal rights and obligations, which are purely personal in their nature and are only enforceable by action against the party in default. <b>Section 2(h) of the Indian Contract Act,1872 </b>defines a contract as <b>&quot;An agreement enforceable by law&quot;. </b>A contract to which The Central Government or a State Government is a party is called a &quot;Government Contract&quot;. Government contracts have been accorded Constitutional recognition. The Constitution, under <b>Article 298 </b>, clearly lays down that the executive power of the Union and of each state extends to &quot;the carrying on of any trade or business and to the acquisition, holding and disposal of property and the making of contracts for any purpose&quot;. The Constitution therefore, provides that a government may sue or be sued by its own name.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Is President or governor can be held liable</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 299(2) <span class="p">immunizes the President, or the Governor, or the person executing any contract on his behalf, from any personal liability in respect of any contract executed for the purposes of the Constitution, or for purposes of any enactment relating to the Government of India heretofore in force.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Earlier, a view was expressed that when a contract was not in proper form, the exemption of Art. 299(2) would not apply to the officer executing the contract and it could be enforced against him personally under <b>S. 230(3) of the Indian Contract Act. </b>But, a different view was expressed by the Supreme Court in <b>State of Uttar Pradesh v. Murari Lal</b>. A contract entered</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">into without complying with Art. 299(1) is void. There is no contract in the eyes of law and so Sec. 230(3) of the Contract Act is inapplicable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In order to protect innocent parties, the courts have held that if government derives any benefit under an agreement not fulfilling the requisites of Art. 299(1), the Government may be held liable to compensate the other contracting party under <b>S. 70 of the Indian Contract </b>Act, on the basis of a quasi-contractual liability, to the extent of the benefit received. The reason is that it is not just and equitable for government to retain any benefit it has received under an agreement which does not bind it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Interrelation Between Article 300 and Section 79 of Civil Procedure code</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">As per Article 300(1), The Government of India may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the Government of a State may sue or be sued by the name of the State provisions which may be made by Act of Parliament or of the Legislature of such State enacted by virtue of powers conferred by this Constitution, sue or be sued in relation to their respective affairs in the like cases as the Dominion of India and the corresponding Provinces.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">A similar provision is found in the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 under Section 79 of the Code provides that in a suit by or against the Government the authority to be named as Plaintiff &amp; Defendant in case of:</p><ol id="l3"><li data-list-text="(i)"><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: justify;">By or against Central Government</h1></li><li data-list-text="(ii)"><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: justify;">State government or State</h1></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In Chief Conservator of Forests, <b>Government of A.P. v.
