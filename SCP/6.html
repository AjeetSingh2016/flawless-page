It is a ‘right to constitutional remedies’ which provides a right to protect other fundamental rights from violation. In other words, if any fundamental right is violated by the government, then Article 32 empowers the person whose fundamental right has been violated to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of his/her fundamental rights.

It is to be noted here that the power has been given to issue <b>appropriate directions, orders or writs</b>. The writs which the Supreme Court can issue include the writs in the nature of the five writs mentioned in Article 32- <b>habeas corpus, mandamus s, prohibition, quo-warranto and certiorari</b>. The power of the Supreme Court in Clause (2) is not confined only to these five writs only.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It extends to issuing of any directions or orders that may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights. Article 32 provides for an expeditious and <b>inexpensive remedy </b>for the protection of fundamental rights from legislative and executive interference. (See <b>Constitution Assembly Debates (C.A.D) Vol. VII at 953</b>.)</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Article 32 can be suspended</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In India, <b>Clause (4) of Article 32 of the Constitution of India also provides for an exception to the right guaranteed under Article 32(1). </b>When the President proclaims an emergency under Article 352, the provision for guaranteed remedy of fundamental rights remains suspended. In such times, the <b>President may, under Article 358</b>, make a separate proclamation by which Article 32 remains suspended. In other words, an individual <b>cannot, during such emergency, move the Supreme Court</b>, even if he feels that he has been unduly deprived of the Fundamental Right guaranteed by the Constitution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">But, <b>B R Ambedkar</b>, the chief architect of the Constitution, observed in the constituent assembly that the interests of the state as a whole are of much greater importance than those of the individual and, hence, individual liberty cannot be allowed to destroy the very fabric of national security. He observed, &quot;...<b>it is equally clear that in certain cases, where, for example, the state&#39;s very life is in jeopardy, these rights must be subject to a certain amount of limitations&quot;</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Particularly, the Constitution was drafted during a period of <b>horrid ordeal marked by war</b>, infiltration, partition, communal riots <b>and other subversive activities</b>.(See <b>D.D.Basu, Introduction to the Constitution of India (21st Edition, Lexis Nexis 2013) 100</b>) This is why, the makers felt that during an emergency, the enforcement of fundamental rights should remain suspended because the unrestrained right of the individual might, in such times, <b>endanger the security of the nation </b>as a whole. But, in normal times, fundamental rights seem to be &#39;fundamental&#39;.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Note <span class="p">- The impact of emergency on the Fundamental Rights is much more pervasive in India than is the case in the U.S.A .</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Position in U.S.A and Britain</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In (<b>Schenck vs. U.S., 246</b>) No other Fundamental Right can be suspended in the U.S.A., but <b>during an emergency, courts do give somewhat restrictive interpretation </b>to these rights than do during the normal days. In Britain, during the two world wars, drastic discretionary powers were <b>conferred on the Executive to interfere with the rights of property </b>and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">person of the people. This drastic interference with people’s rights received judicial sanction in several cases. The theory is that when the country is engaged in a war of survival, the people also go down. (See <b>Rex vs. Halliday, 1917</b>)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">(Violation of a Fundamental Right <b>is sine qua non of the exercise of the right </b>conferred by Art. 32(See <b>Federation of Bar Association of Karnataka vs. Union of India, 2000</b>). Art. 32 cannot be invoked simply to adjudge the validity of any legislation or an administrative action unless <b>it adversely affects petitioner’s Fundamental Rights</b>. Reason behind this is very obvious it will bring the burden on supreme court and may lead to backlog cases. It is against principal of right to Speedy trial which is integral part of Art. 21.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Article 226 titled as Powers of the High Court to issue Certain Writs</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 226(1) starts with <b>Non-Obstanate clause </b>(Notwithstanding anything under Article 32) means power of supreme court under <b>article 32 cannot affect Article 226</b>. Through writs, the High Courts are able to control, to some extent, <b>the administrative authorities </b>in the modern administrative age.

The jurisdiction was, however, limited territorially as each</p><h1 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">High Court could issue a writ not throughout the whole of its territorial jurisdiction but only </span>within the area of the Presidency Town <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/" class="s1" target="_blank">within which it enjoyed an original jurisdiction. As held in the case of </a><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/" class="a" target="_blank">Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of </a>India<span class="p">, the scope of </span>Article 226 is much wider than Article 32 <span class="p">as it confers power to the High Courts to issue orders, directions, and writs not only for the enforcement of fundamental rights but </span>also for the enforcement of legal rights <span class="p">which are conferred to the disadvantaged by way of certain statutes and are as important as the fundamental rights.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The jurisdiction thus conferred on a High Court is to protect not only the Fundamental Rights but even any other legal right as is clear from the words <b>‘any other purpose’</b>. This Constitutional Right to access the High Court cannot be fettered and more so by the Court itself e.g. by directing the petitioner to deposit money as a condition precedent to such access. (See <b>Grand Vasant Residents Welfare Assn. v. DDA, 2005</b>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Further, the words in the Article ‘<b>in the nature’ of writs imply that a High Court is not obligated to follow all the procedural technicalities of the English law </b>relating to writs, or changes of judicial opinions from case to case there, but should keep to the broad and fundamental features of these writs as followed in the English law.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">A petition is not thrown out merely because the proper writ has not been prayed for. (See <b>Basappa v. Nagappa,1954</b>). And The writ system provides an expeditious and less expensive remedy than any other remedy available through the normal Court-process.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Proceedings in exercise of writ jurisdiction are different from proceedings in a civil suit (<b>Commr. of Endowments v. Vittal Rao, 2005</b>) So it cannot be affected by <b>order 23 rule 4 of CPC</b>. And Power of High court under 226, is confined to the provisions of statue means the <b>doctrine of equity, justice, good conscience </b>cannot be extended in awarding interest, contrary to or beyond the provisions of the Statute and the Court has no power to award interest in a manner other than one prescribed by Statute.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Admistrative Action by the state is <b>subjected to judicial review </b>under Article 226. A writ petition <b>cannot be filed under Art. 226 </b>merely to enforce a purely contractual obligation. For this purpose, the proper remedy is a suit for damages or specific performance. (See <b>Har Shankar v. Dy. Excise and Taxation Commr.,1975</b>) It has been held that the Courts have no jurisdiction to give directions for amending statutory rules framed by the executive. (See <b>State of Manipur v. Ksh. Moirangninthou Singh, 2007</b>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 226(2) read with Section 20(c) of CPC, The High Court can issue a writ even when the <b>person resides, or the authority is located</b>, outside its territorial jurisdiction if the cause of action wholly or partially arises within the Court’s territorial jurisdiction. the phraseology used in Section 20(c) CPC and Article 226(2) being in pari materia,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Cause of action implies a <b>right to sue</b>. The material facts which are imperative for the suitor to allege and prove constitute the cause of action. Cause of action is not defined in any statute. As per <b>Kusum Ingots &amp; Alloys Ltd. v. Union of India, 2004 </b>When a part of the cause of action arises within one or the other High Court, it will be for the petitioner to choose his forum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Alchemist Ltd. v. State Bank of Sikkim, 2007 </b>the Supreme Court has reiterated that for the purpose of deciding whether facts averred in a writ petition would or would not constitute a part of cause of action, one has to consider whether such facts constitute a <b>material, essential or integral part of the cause of action </b>and that in determining this question the substance of the matter and not form has to be considered. Even if a small faction of the cause of action arises within the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court would have territorial jurisdiction to entertain the petition.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distinction Between Article 32 And 226</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Therefore, in the matter of enforcement of fundamental rights, the High Courts under Art. 226 and the Supreme Court under Article 32, enjoy <b>concurrent jurisdiction</b>. The difference in the phraseology of Arts. 32 and 226 brings out the marked difference in the nature and purpose of the right conferred by these Articles. Whereas the right guaranteed by <b>Art.32 </b>can be exercised for the <b>enforcement of fundamental rights only</b>, the right conferred by Art.226 can be exercised not only for the enforcement of fundamental rights <b>but for “any other purpose”.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Thus, the power of the High Court is wider than the power to issue writs not only for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but for the enforcement of rights other than fundamental rights, whereas Art. 32 can be invoked only for the enforcement of fundamental rights and for no other purpose. It may be emphasized that a <b>PIL writ petition </b>can be filed in the Supreme Court under <b>Art. 32 only if a question concerning the enforcement of a Fundamental Right </b>is involved whereas under Art. 226, a writ petition can be filed in a High Court <b>whether or not a Fundamental Right is involved</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">A question has been raised whether a petitioner seeking to enforce his fundamental rights can go straight to the Supreme Court under Art.32, or should he first go to a High Court under Art.226. As early as 1950, in <b>Romesh Thapar Case</b>, the Supreme Court ruled that such <b>a petitioner can come straight to the Supreme Court without going to the High Court first</b>. The Court stated that unlike Art.226, Art.32 confers a fundamental right on the individual and imposes an <b>obligation on the Supreme Court which it must discharge </b>when a person complains of the infringement of a Fundamental Right. Article 32 provides a guaranteed remedy for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights and constitutes the Supreme Court as the “<b>Guarantor and protector of fundamental rights</b>”.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This proposition has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in a number of cases. This continued to be the position till 1987 when a two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court ruled in <b>Kanubhai Brahmbhatt vs. State of Gujarat,1987</b>, that a petitioner complaining of infraction of his fundamental right should approach the High Court first <b>rather than the Supreme Court in the first instance</b>. The reason given for this view was that there was a huge backlog of cases pending before the Supreme Court. Since, it is a view expressed by a two Judge Bench, it cannot be considered to be an <b>authoritative pronouncement </b>on an important constitutional issue, viz., inter-relationship between Arts.32 and 226.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Such a vital pronouncement could be made only by a Constitution Bench consisting of atleast 5 Judges, especially, when the long established position is sought to be overturned. The ruling in Kanubhai seeks to negate what the Supreme Court has itself said <b>in a number of cases during the last four decades </b>emphasizing upon the significance of Art.32, and the role assigned to it thereunder.(See <b>State of Madras vs. V.G.Row, 1952</b>) In practice, it seems that the Kanubhai announcement has had no effect on the existing practice and the writ petitions continue to be filed in the <b>Supreme Court under Art. 32 without going to the High Court under Art.226. </b>And Art. 32 is it self a fundamental Right so it is the duty of the Supreme court to uphold the Constitution.</p></body></html>
