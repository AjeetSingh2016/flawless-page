Article 256 is the successor of <b>Section 122 of Government of India Act 1935 </b>Although this provision is particularly silent about the consequences in case of non-compliance, the drastic sanction is laid down in Art. 365 of Constitution.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">To explain, As per <b>Article 365 </b>if a State fails to comply with the directions issued by the Centre, then <b>it is lawful for the President </b>to hold that a situation has arisen wherein the State government <b>cannot be carried on according to the provisions of the Constitution</b>. Consequently, a state emergency can be imposed.

Usually, while entrusting its functions, the centre reserves to itself power to issue directions to delegate states for the exercise of powers so delegated. The delegation of the functions has to be with the consent of the concerned state government. A notification issued by the President under Article 258 (1) entrusting functions to a state government has been held to be a legislative act.(See Jayantilal Amritlal, 1964) Moreover, the delegation under clause (1) of article 258 may be specific, to one or more</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">states named therein, or it may be general i.e. to all the states.

It must also be noticed that only a executive function can be delegated under clause (1) of Article 258, and not a quasi-judicial function.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">However in <b>Shamsher Singh v.
