They had laid down further that no person would be subjected to prolonged detention preceding trial, to excessive bail or unreasonable refusal of bail, to inhuman, or cruel punishment or to denial of adequate safeguards and proper procedure.(<b>See K.K. Munshi‟s draft, articles v(1)(e) and v (4) and article XII (3)).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ambedkar’s draft also had included a provision that the State should not deprive any</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">person of life, liberty or property without the “due process of law” (<b>See Ambedkar‟s draft, article 11 (1) (2)). </b>The Sub-Committee on Fundamental Rights discussed the subject and included in its draft report two clauses, 11 and 29:</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“11. No person shall be deprived of his life, liberty or property without due process of law.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">“29. No person shall be subjected to prolonged detention preceding trial, to excessive bail, or unreasonable refusal thereof, or to inhuman or cruel punishment.”(See Minutes and Draft Report of the Sub-Committee, Annexure, clauses 11 and 29).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The provision regarding the right to be informed of the authority and grounds of</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">deprivation of one‟s liberty within twenty-four hours was omitted in view of the “due</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">process of law” provision –clause 11. After much divergent debates and discussions on the most controversial “due process clause”, it was felt that draft Article 15(Corresponding provision in the Constitution: Article 21) gave to Parliament a carte blanche to provide for the arrest of any person under any circumstances it deemed fit.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Hence, a new Article 15 A was drafted. Introducing this Article in the Assembly on September 15, 1949, Ambedkar claimed that in substance the Article contained the substance of the law of <b>“due processes”. </b>The first two clauses embodied two of the most fundamental principles of justice recognised by every civilized country and which were already contained in the Criminal Procedure Code. He said, that the Article only sought to raise these principles to the status of constitutional guarantees so as to restrict the power of Parliament and state Legislatures to abrogate them by legislation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This Article, as moved by Ambedkar elicited wide criticism. Subsequent to a long debate, Ambedkar accepted certain points made by the critics. In response to a common point stressing on the need for fixing a time limit for informing the grounds of arrest to the arrested person, Ambedkar said that the words “as soon as may be” were integrally connected with clause (2), requiring no person to be detained in custody for more than twenty-four hours without authority for such detention being obtained from a Magistrate. Since the Magistrate had obviously to be told of the grounds of arrest, “as soon as may be” could not extend beyond twenty-four hours.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Regarding another objection he agreed to add “and be defended by a legal practictioner after the words “to consult” so as to remove any ambiguity. He clarified that in order to curtail the complete power of the Union and the States to legislate on preventive detention, as already possessed by virtue of the entries in the lists, this new Article intended to render this power subject to certain specific limitations. In the absence of such a provision, the Legislatures might make any kind of law for preventive detention.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Regarding another criticism as legitimate, he agreed to amend the draft Article to provide for the requirement to communicate the grounds of such detention to the person concerned as soon as may be –unless it was against public interest to disclose the facts. The new draft Article 15-A as amended was adopted by the Assembly. In the course of revision, the Draft Committee renumbered Article 15-A as Article 22.The proviso to clause (3) of Draft Article 15-A was converted into an independent clause (4) in the renumbered Art. 22 and clauses (3-a), (3-b) and (4) were redrafted and renumbered as clauses (5), (6) and (7) respectively. These changes were only of drafting nature</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 22 (1) No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="(2)"><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(3)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Nothing in clauses (1) and (2) shall apply—</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="(a)"><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">to any person who for the time being is an enemy alien;

Even in <b>State of Madhya Pradesh v Shobharam, 1966 </b>The rights given by Article 22(1) and (2) are absolute in themselves and do not depend on other laws. Even though Articles 21 and 22 go together but they cannot be treated as inter-related or interdependent. Art. 22 (3) enact two exceptions to the fundamental rights otherwise guaranteed to the arrested persons under Clause (1) &amp; (2), i.e., these protections are not available in case of an enemy alien and a person arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Right to be Informed Article 22(1)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Part 1 of Article 22(1) deals with a person who is arrested cannot be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest. It means that he is to be informed of the grounds for his arrest. And <b>Section 50 of CrPc </b>casts a strict duty on the part of the police officer making the arrest immediately to communicate the grounds of arrest to the arrested person.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The basis of this rule is to enable the arrested person to prepare his defence, and to move the court for bail. It can be read with <b>Article 21 of the Constitution </b>mean to say if you detain someone it must be in accordance procedure established by law. If the Arrest is not in accordance with the law then it may lead to unlawful detention.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">And part II deals with a right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice. <b>Section 56 of CrPC </b>Any person accused of an offence before a Criminal Court may of right be defended by a pleader of his choice. When a person arrested in relation to a cognizable offence and is first produced before a magistrate, he becomes entitled to the right to access to legal aid, to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner. It is obligatory for such magistrate to make the arrestee fully aware of his right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner and, that one would be provided to him from legal aid at the expense of the State if he has no means to engage a lawyer of his choice. It is the Constitutional duty of the court to provide him with a lawyer before the commencement of the trial even if the accused never asks for it or he remains silent, and this obligation is absolute.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The failure to fulfil this obligation at the commencement of the trial would have the effect of vitiating the trial, the resultant conviction and sentence, if any, given to the accused.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">However, the failure to provide a lawyer to the accused at the pre-trial stage may not have the same consequence of vitiating the trial <b>(See Mohammed Ajmal Mohammad Amir Kasab Abu Mujahid v State Of Maharashtra(2012)).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presence of the lawyer during Interrogation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Poolpandi v Suprintendent, Central Excise (1992), </b>the Court did not accept that a person summoned for interrogation is entitled to the presence of his lawyer during questioning. In</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">D.K. Basu v State of West Bengal<span class="p">, the Supreme Court issued directions to be followed as preventive measures in all cases of arrest or detention to the effect that the arrestee may be permitted to meet his lawyer during interrogation, though not throughout the</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">interrogation. In a recent case Directorate of Revenue Intelligence v Jugal Kishore Samra 2011, the Court did not accept the contention that the respondent is entitled as of right, to the presence of his lawyer at the time of his interrogation in connection with the case.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The role of a lawyer, as per our legal system, mainly focuses on court proceedings. It is only for the purpose of resisting remand to police or judicial custody and for granting of bail.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Right To Be Produced Before The Magistrate Within 24 Hours Article 22(2)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>Article 22(2), </b>Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate. And <b>section 56 of CrPc </b>deals with Person arrested to be taken before Magistrate or officer in charge of police station.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This is a mandatory provision and is based on the policy of law that the magistrate before whom a prisoner is produced must be in a position to bring an independent judgement to bear on the matter. This provision is not to be treated as a mere formality. Its purpose is to enable the person arrested to be released on bail, or other provision made for his proper custody, while the investigation is pending for the offences with which he is charged pending an enquiry or trial <b>(See State of Uttar Pradesh v Abdul Samad, 1962).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rational behind preventive Detention under Constitution</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Preventive detention means detention of a person without trial and conviction by a court, merely on the basis of suspicion or reasonable probability in the mind of an executive authority that the detenue has the potential of committing prejudicial act. Preventive detention has been regarded as ‘sinister-looking’ feature out of place in a democratic</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Constitution, necessarily designed to prevent the abuse of freedom by anti-social and subversive elements which might imperil the national welfare. <b>(See A.K.Gopalan v State of Madras, 1950).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is a drastic power to detain a person without trial and in many countries it is not allowed to be exercised except in times of war or aggression. Preventive detention has not been unknown in other democratic countries like Britain, U.S.A. and Canada, but limited as a war time measure. The Indian Constitution recognises preventive detention in peace time also. It is preventive, not punitive, in theory. The purpose of preventive detention is not to punish an individual for any wrong done by him, but to curtail his liberty, with a view to preempt him from indulging in conduct injurious to the society <b>(See Francis Coralie Mullin v The Administrator, Union of India, 1981).</b></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The law of preventive detention must, therefore, pass the test not only of Article 22 but also of Article 21. It is a power to be exercised with the greatest care and caution and the courts have to be ever vigilant to see that this power is not abused or misused. The restrictions placed on a person preventively detained must, consistently with the effectiveness of detention, be minimal <b>(See Sampat Prakash v State of Jammu and Kashmir (1969)).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Safeguards Against The Order Of Preventive Detention</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Art. 22 Clauses (4) to (7) <span class="p">lay down a few safeguards, and provide for minimum procedure to be observed in case of preventive detention. Any law or administrative action relating to preventive detention infringing these safeguards would be rendered invalid as infringing the fundamental rights of the detainee. The scope and ambit of these safeguards and those evolved by the judicial interpretation aim at protecting the liberty of detenue against bureaucratic lethargy, insensitivity, red tape and casual approach.</span></h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per the <b>Article 22(4) </b>states that no law framed for preventive detention gives authority to detain any person <b>for more than 3 months </b>unless; an advisory board reports a sufficient cause for such detention. The people on the advisory board should be equally qualified as that of a judge of the high court. The report needs to be submitted before the expiration of said 3 months.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">A person already in custody can be detained when there are reasonable and sufficient causes to do so. The focal problem being that in cases of preventive detention there is no way to check whether the cause of detention is just and reasonable until it is presented to the advisory board which is applicable after the stretch of 3 months.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>Article 22(5) </b>When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">But without getting information sufficient to make a representation against the order of detention it is not possible for the detenue to make the representation. The import of Art. 22(5) is that all facts and particulars which influence the detaining authority in arriving at its satisfaction must be communicated to the detenue. An effective representation is not possible against the detention order unless copies of material documents considered and relied upon by the detaining authority in arriving at his satisfaction to detain the detenue were supplied to him <b>(See Sophia GulamMohd. Bhan v State of Maharashtra, 1999).</b></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">There is no further description or time limit assigned for the end result of representation made, which can be inferred as a means to keep lingering the issue at hand and aid in wrongful detention of the person.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Exception made under 22(6)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1782826/" class="a" target="_blank">Clause </a>6 of the article is similar in nature to clause 3 as it stands an exception to clause 5 and states that the detaining authority is not mandatorily required to disclose any such facts which it considers to be against the public interest to disclose.
