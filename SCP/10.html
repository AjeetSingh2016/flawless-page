It sets out a double division between the Union and the states with legislative powers i.e, in territorial recognition and relation to the subject.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Article 245 <span class="p">exclusively deals with Extent of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States. As per </span>Article 245(1) <span class="p">“Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, Parliament may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India, and the Legislature of a State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State.” From the territorial point of view, Parliament may make laws for the whole of India, or a part thereof [Art. 245(1). A law made by Parliament is not invalid merely because it has an extra-territorial operation as per Art. 245(2).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Point to be noted here is under (clause 1) both can make the laws as far as territory is concerned but an immunity grant from invalidation is only for parliament not for state legislature, As per <b>‘Prof. MP Jain’, </b>A State Legislature has no legislative competence to make laws having extra-territorial operation. A State can legislate effectively only for its own territory. A State law can affect persons, properties or things within the State and not outside the State. A State law is not immune from challenge in a Court on the ground of extra-territorial operation. A State law having operation outside the State is not valid.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distribution of legislative powers:</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The crux, the pivotal point, of a federal constitution is the division of powers and functions between the Centre and the regions. The distribution of legislative powers between the Centre and the regions is the most important characteristic of a federal constitution. The foundation for a federal set up was laid in the <b>Government of India Act, 1935</b>. Though in every respect the distribution of legislative power between the Union and the States as envisaged in the 1935 Act has not been adopted in the Constitution.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">A basic test applied to decide what subjects should be allotted to the one or the other level of government is that functions of national importance should go to the Centre, and those of local interest should go to the regions. This test is very general, a sort of ad hoc formula, and does not lead to any uniform pattern of allocation of powers and functions between the two tiers of government in all federal countries. The reason for this lack of uniformity is that what is of general or national importance, and what is of local importance, cannot be decided on any a priori basis. Certain subjects like defence, foreign affairs and currency, are regarded as being of national importance everywhere and are thus given to the Centre. But, beyond this, what other subjects should be allotted to the Centre depends on the exigencies of the situation existing in the country, the attitudes of the people and the philosophy prevailing, at the time of constitution-making, and the future role which the Centre is envisaged to play.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per section 246(1) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the “Union List”). (Notwithstanding anything in clause means nothing shall effect provisons under clause 2 and 3 to clause 1 it is independent and exclusive in nature.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per article 246(3), “ Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the “State List”).”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Thus, if a particular matter falls within the exclusive competence of the States, i.e. List II, that represents the prohibited field for the Centre.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">A unique feature of the Indian scheme of division of powers is the existence of a large concurrent field for the Centre and the States. Art. 246(2) confers a concurrent power of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">legislation on both the Centre and the States with respect to the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List (List III in the Seventh Schedule).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The general idea underlying the Concurrent List is that there may be subjects on which Parliament may not feel it necessary or expedient to initiate legislation in the first instance because these matters may not have assumed much national importance. A State may, therefore, make necessary legislation with respect to any matter in the Concurrent List. But, if at any time, any of these matters assumes a national importance, and requires to be dealt with on a uniform all-India basis, then the Centre can step in and enact necessary legislation. Further, even when the Centre makes a law for the whole country on a matter in the Concurrent List, a State may also make, if necessary, supplementary laws on that matter to provide for special circumstances within the State.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per clause 4 of Article 246, “Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India not included [in a State] notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List.” Under Art. 246(4), Parliament is given power to make a law on any matter in any List for any territory not included in a State. Obviously, the reference here is to the Union Territories</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Residuary Powers of the legislations</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1270258/" class="a" target="_blank">The Constitution also confers on the Union Parliament residual powers (subjects not mentioned on any of the three lists). Article </a><a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/pdf1/S7.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">248 notes that, concerning anything that is not listed in any of the three lists, the Parliament has the exclusive authority to make legislation. Entry 97 of List </a>I also provides for the exclusive powers of Parliament to make laws on all subjects not mentioned in List II or III. The remaining powers of legislation shall be solely delegated to the Union Parliament under Article 248 and Entry 97 List.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Although the Central Government does not have the power in the common circumstances to legislate on matters mentioned in that State, the Parliament of the Union may only make laws on such matters under some special conditions. These special conditions are:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Parliament Power to legislate over State jurisdiction:</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In the National Interest: According to Article 249, if the Rajya Sabha declares, by a resolution supported by two thirds of the members present and voting, that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest that Parliament should make laws with respect to a matter in the State List specified in the resolution, it becomes lawful for Parliament to make laws for the whole or any part of India with respect to that matter so long as the resolution stands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Such a resolution may remain in force for such period as is mentioned therein but not exceeding one year; it can be renewed as many times as may be necessary but not exceeding a year at a time. The law made by Parliament in the State List under this provision would cease to have effect six months after the resolution passed by Rajya Sabha comes to an end.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Under clause 2 The procedure is of strictly temporary efficacy as the life of the resolution is limited to one year at a time. If Central power is required to be continued beyond one year, a fresh resolution will have to be passed by the Rajya Sabha for another year and so on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per prof. MP Jain<span class="p">, The function entrusted to the Rajya Sabha under this Article emanates from the theory that this House contains representatives of the States who are elected by the State Legislative Assemblies.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">For example, in 1950, due to the Korean War, prices of imported goods began to soar. There was great need to effectively control black marketing. No action could be taken to control imported goods under entry 33, List III, as it stood before its amendment in 1955</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">because it did not then cover imported goods. Therefore, under Art. 249, Rajya Sabha passed a resolution to enable Parliament to make laws for a period of one year with respect to entries 26 and 27 of List II. Parliament then enacted the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Amendment Act, 1950, and the Supply and Prices of Goods Act, 1950, for controlling supply, distribution and price of certain goods.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Proclamation of emergency:<span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Article 250 of Constitution read with article 352 of constitution in the case of a declaration of emergency, Parliament shall have the power to make law on any item on the State List. Article 250 does not restrict the power of a State Legislature to make a law which it is entitled to make under the Constitution. However, because of Art. 251, in case of repugnancy between a State law and a Parliamentary law enacted under Art. 250, the latter is to prevail and the State law, to the extent of repugnancy, and so long as the Parliamentary law continues, is to be inoperative.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">By Agreement between States<span class="p">: As per Article 252(1) of Constitution, If it appears to the Legislatures of two or more States to be desirable that any of the matters with respect to which Parliament has no power to make laws for the States (except as provided in articles 249 and 250) should be regulated in such States by Parliament by law, and if resolutions to that effect are passed by all the Houses of the Legislatures of those States, it shall be lawful for Parliament to pass an Act for regulating that matter accordingly, and any Act so passed shall apply to such States and to any other State by which it is adopted afterwards by resolution passed in that behalf by the House or, where there are two Houses, by each of the Houses of the Legislature of that State.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In the context of Art. 252(1), the term ‘<b>State Legislature’ </b>means only the House or Houses of the Legislature without including the Governor. Therefore, Governor’s assent is not necessary to the resolution passed by the House or Houses <b>(see Union of India v.</b></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Basavaiah Choudhary,1979).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Parliament enacted the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, after resolutions under Art. 252(1) were adopted by eleven State Legislatures</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Article 252(2) read as…..</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: center;">“Any Act so passed by Parliament may be amended or repealed by an Act of Parliament passed or adopted in like manner but shall not, as respects any State to which it applies, be amended or repealed by an Act of the Legislature of that State.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Because of Art. 252(2), the State Legislatures have no power to repeal or amend an Act passed by Parliament under Art. 252(1). Only Parliament can amend or repeal it in the manner laid down in Art. 252(2). The effect of Art. 252, therefore, is that the State Legislature loses its power to make laws on the subject to the extent its field is covered by the resolution under Art. 252(1) although the matter continues to remain in List II.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">To implement the treatise (Article 253):<span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/741672/" class="a" target="_blank">To implement treaties or international conventions, Parliament shall have the power to legislate concerning any subject.
