      The jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court are similar to those of
      the Federal Court. Article 124 of the Indian Constitution provides for the establishment of the Supreme
      Court. The Supreme Court became operational on 28th January, 1950, and
      the first judge to preside over the Supreme Court of India was Hon’ble
      Mr. Justice Harilal Jekisundas Kania.

      In <b>State of Bihar v. Union of India, 1970</b>, State of Bihar filed a

      claiming damages for short supply of iron and steel ordered by the State
      in connection with the Gandak Project. The Court held that the suit did
      not lie under Art. 131, because its phraseology excludes the idea of a
      private citizen, a firm or a corporation, figuring as a disputant either
      alone or along with a government.<br> “The most important feature of Art. 131 is that it makes no mention of any party
      other than the   Government of India or any one or more of the States who can be arrayed as

      can be impleaded as a party in a suit under Art. 131, along with a state
      either jointly or in the alternative.

      It was argued that Hindustan Steel could be regarded as a

      for that purpose. This means that only inter-governmental disputes can be

      The Court held that Article 131 requires the Court to adjudicate only on
      the legal right concerned and the Court is not required to adjudicate on
      the complete dispute. The Court further held that the petition under
      Article 131 was not maintainable as the dispute would fall within the
      ambit of Article 131 only if no private party was involved in the dispute.
      Even if the private party was impleaded jointly with the government, the
      petition would be beyond the scope of Article 131.
