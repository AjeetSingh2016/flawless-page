The Executive thus comes before Parliament <b>every year to ask for grants for the ensuing year </b>so that Parliament gets an opportunity of reviewing, criticising and discussing the activities and policies pursued by the Government during the preceding year. The parliamentary process to make annual appropriations passes through several stages. The first stage is the presentation of an annual financial statement, popularly known as the Budget. The Budget is <b>presented by the Finance Minister on the last working day in February every year</b>. It is the statement of the estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of India for the following year <b>(April 1 to March 31).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">“Annual financial statement” <span class="p">is defined under Article 112 as </span>a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of India for that year<span class="p">, and President laid down the bill before the parliament.

Like salaries and allowances of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Council of States and the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the House of the People (See Art. 112(3)(b)), the salaries, allowances and pensions payable to or in respect of Judges of the Supreme Court (See Art. 112(2)(d)(i)).

The member giving notice of such a Cut Motion has to indicate in precise terms the particulars of the policy which he proposes to discuss. Discussion is confined to the specific point or points mentioned in the notice and it is open to the member to advocate an alternative policy.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Economy Cut</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Where the object of the motion is to effect economy in the expenditure, the form of the</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">motion is “That the amount of the demand be reduced by Rs...(a specified amount)”.

As per Article 114(1)(b), The Appropriation Bill provides for appropriation out of the Consolidated Fund of all moneys required to meet the grants assented to by Lok Sabha and the expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund, and in no case the amount under each head can exceed what was shown previously in the Budget.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per Article 114(2), No amendment can be proposed to this Bill in any House of Parliament so as to vary the amount or alter the destination of any grant previously agreed to by Lok Sabha or to vary the amount of an expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund.

Votes of credit may be used in times of emergency when Parliament may vote a lump sum without allocating it to any particular object.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Lok Sabha is also authorised to make an exceptional grant which forms no part of the current service of any financial year [Art. 116(1)(c)]. After the Lok Sabha assents to any of these grants, Parliament has to enact a law to withdraw moneys from the Consolidated Fund. In making these grants and passing the law, the procedure prescribed for making annual appropriations is to be followed [Art. 116(2)].</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per Article 114(3), no money shall be withdrawn under Article 114, 115 from the Consolidated Fund of India except under appropriation made by law passed in accordance with the provisions of this article.</p></body></html>
