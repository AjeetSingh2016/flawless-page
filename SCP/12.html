Nevertheless, the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">member published the disallowed questions in a local journal. A government servant filed a complaint against the member as well as the editor, printer and publisher of the journal that the member concerned had published false and scandalous imputations against him with a view to harming his reputation. The matter ultimately came before the Supreme Court.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Court ruled that the said publication did not fall within the scope of <b>Art. 194(2)</b></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">[<b>equivalent to Art. 105(2)</b>] as it was neither under the authority of the House nor</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">“anything said or vote given by a member of the Assembly.” Immunity of a member of a House for speeches made by him in the House does not extend to publication thereof by him outside the House.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Watson vs Walter </b>the court dismissed the action saying that the advantage to the community from publication of the proceedings of a House “is so great, that the occasional inconvenience to individuals arising from it must yield to the general good”.

Some of these provisions may be regarded by the courts as merely directory and not mandatory, the breach of which would amount only to procedural irregularity (curable under <b>Art. 122</b>) which would not vitiate the action taken by the House.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Thus, the provision that the certificate that a bill is a Money Bill is to be granted by the Speaker, is only directory and if the certificate is granted by the Deputy Speaker who presides over the House, and the Upper House acting on it proceeds with the bill as a Money Bill, the resultant Act is not bad constitutionally.
