      The ambit of Art-20(2) is however, narrower than the English or the
      American rule against double jeopardy. The Indian provision enunciates
      only the principle of ‘autrefois convict’ but not that of
      <b>‘atrefois acquit’</b>. In England and the USA, both these rules operate
      and a second trial is barred even when the accused had been acquitted at
      the first trial for that offence. In India on the other hand, the rule of
      ‘autrefois acquit’ is not incorporated in Art. 20 (2). Art 20 (2) can be
      invoked only when there has been prosecution and punishment in the first
      instance. Both prosecution and punishment must co-exist for Art. 20 (2) to
      be operative.

      The rationale rudimentary to this provision was well acknowledged in
      <b>Saunders v. United Kingdom 1997 </b>protection of accused is necessary
      against the improper compulsion of the concerned authorities in order to
      avoid miscarriage of justice. Ethics may be one point which forms the
      bases for this privilege. Its rational is to protect the accused from the
      brutalization by the investigators as such these involuntary statements if
      alone given weightage in the trial, then it would be easier for the
      investigating agency to just to arrest anyone on word of the victim and
      subject them to coercion, threats in order to obtain enough evidence to
      incriminate the accused. Even if such methods are proved to be good, it
      shall not be ignored that such kinds of tactics are violative of basic
      Human Rights of Life.

      Indian Constitution by this very limitation only, narrows down the scope
      of the protection against self-incrimination. The benefit of the provision
      is only available to the accused persons in order to safeguard them from
      the forceful probing or interrogation practices of the authorities. No
      such protection is available to the “witnesses” under Indian Laws; the
      system has failed to foresee that the “witnesses” may be subjected to the
      harsh treatment.
