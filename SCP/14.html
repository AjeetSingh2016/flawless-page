If the recommended amendments are accepted by the Lok Sabha, the Money Bill is considered to be passed by both the Houses of Parliament. If the amendments suggested by Rajya Sabha are rejected by Lok Sabha, then also the Money Bill</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">is deemed to have been passed by both the House of Parliament in the same way as it would have been passed by Lok Sabha without any recommendation of Rajya Sabha</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How is a Money Bill different from a Financial bill </p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">While all Money Bills are Financial Bills, all Financial Bills are not Money Bills. For example, the Finance Bill which only contains provisions related to tax proposals would be a Money Bill. However, a Bill that contains some provisions related to taxation or expenditure, but also covers other matters would be considered as a Financial Bill.  The Compensatory Afforestation Fund Bill, 2015, which establishes Fund under the Public Account of India and states, was introduced as a Financial Bill. Secondly, as highlighted above, the procedure for the passage of the two bills varies significantly. The Rajya Sabha has no power to reject or amend a Money Bill. However, a Financial Bill must be passed by both Houses of Parliament.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Who decides a Bill is a Money Bill And Certification of of Speaker of House of People</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">As per <b>Article 110(3), </b>The Speaker certifies a Bill as a Money Bill. and the Speakerâ€™s decision is final. As per Article 110(4) There shall be endorsed on every Money Bill when it is transmitted to the Council of States under Article 109 (<b>Procedure of Money Bill</b>), and when it is presented to the President for assent under Article 111, the certificate of the Speaker of the House of the People signed by him that it is a Money Bill.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Is move taken on a Money Bill by the Speaker of the House of People Can be Challenged</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">As per <b>Article 122</b>, Also, the Constitution states that parliamentary proceedings, as well as officers responsible for the conduct of business (such as the Speaker), may not be questioned by any Court.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Relation and Interrelation between Money bill and Financial Bill</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Two incidents are common between a Money and a Financial Bill. First, both originate only in Lok Sabha and not in Rajya Sabha. Secondly, neither can be introduced without the recommendation of the President <b>[Art. 117(1)]</b>. The stipulation that a Financial Bill should not originate in Rajya Sabha is necessary to safeguard the position of Lok Sabha, for, otherwise, it would have been quite possible for Rajya Sabha to originate a Bill, in essence a Money Bill, by adding something else to it so as to save it from being labelled as a Money</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Bill; and Lok Sabhaâ€™s control over finance would thus have been greatly weakened.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Financial Bills can be divided into two categories:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the <b>first category are Bills which inter-alia contain provisions attracting article 110(1)</b></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">(a) to (f) of the Constitution. <span class="p">They are categorised as Financial Bills under article 117(1) of the Constitution. Like Money Bills, they can be introduced only in Lok Sabha on the recommendation of the President. However, other restrictions in regard to Money Bills do not apply to this category of Bills. Financial Bill under article 117(1) of the Constitution can be referred to a Joint Committee of the Houses.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In the second category are those Bills that inter-alia contain provisions which would on enactment <b>involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India</b>. Such Bills are categorised as Financial Bills under <b>article 117 (3) of the Constitution</b>. Such Bills can be introduced in either House of Parliament. However, recommendation of the President is essential for consideration of these Bills by either House and unless such recommendation</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is received, neither House can pass the Bill.</p></body></html>
