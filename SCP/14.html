A person’s domicile is the country which is considered by law to be his permanent home. Residence in the country, and the intention to make it his home are necessary to constitute a domicile. The residence in a place by itself is not sufficient to constitute it his domicile. It must be accompanied by the intention to make it his permanent home. for neither ‘domicile’ nor mere ‘residence’ is sufficient to make a person an Indian citizen. Domicile and five years’ residence are necessary to make a person a citizen.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.the-laws.com/Encyclopedia/Browse/Case?CaseId=006691730000" style=" color: #212121; font-family:Calibri, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 30pt;" target="_blank">In the case of </a><a href="http://www.the-laws.com/Encyclopedia/Browse/Case?CaseId=006691730000" class="a" target="_blank">Mohd.
