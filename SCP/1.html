</style></head><body><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The freedom of trade, commerce, and intercourse is provided under <b>Part XIII of the Indian Constitution </b><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/121190/" class="a" target="_blank">in Articles 301 to 307. Article </a>301 lays down the general principles of trade and commerce whereas Article 302 to 305 enunciates the restrictions which trade is subjected to. The source for adopting these provisions was the <b>Australian Constitution</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Position in USA, Australia and India</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>Article 1 sec 8 cL 3 (Commerce Clause) </b>that the Congress shall have power to regulate commerce among the several States. The Commerce Clause has also bestowed on the Central Government the <b>necessary power to regulate the country’s economy.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The crucial provision, however, for the purpose in the Australian Constitution is Section 92 according to which <b>trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States </b>shall be absolutely free. The clause applies only to inter-State and not to intra-State commerce, and restricts both the States and the Centre from interfering with trade and commerce.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Hon’ble Bench of Supreme Court in <b>Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. v. State of Assam, 1961 </b>on Arts. 301-305:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It was realised that in course of time different political parties believing in different economic theories or ideologies may come in power in the several constituent units of the Union and that may conceivably give rise to local and regional pulls and pressures in economic matters. Local or regional fears or apprehensions raised by local or regional problems <b>may persuade the State legislatures to adopt remedial measures </b>intended solely for the <b>protection of regional interests without </b>due regard to their effect on the economy of the nation as a whole. The object of [Arts. 301-305] was <b>to avoid such a possibility</b>. Free movement and exchange of goods throughout the territory of India is essential for the economy of the nation and for sustaining and improving living standards of the country.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Article 301 and Article 19(1)(g)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The origins of Art. 301 may be traced directly to Section 92 of the Austalian Constitution Article 301 talks about the freedom of trade, commerce, and intercourse throughout the country. Article 19(1)(g), a fundamental right, confers on the citizens the right to practise any profession or carry on any occupation, trade or business subject to reasonable restrictions in public interest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two Schools of thoughts as far as Article 301 is concerned</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">One view is that while Art. 19(1)(g) deals with the right of the individuals, Art. 301 provides safeguards for the carrying on trade as a whole distinguished from an individual’s right to do the same (<b>See Mukherjea, J., in Saghir Ahmad v. State of U.P., 1954 </b>)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Another View Art. 301 is based on Section 92 of the Australian Constitution which has been held to comprise rights of individuals as well and the same should be the position in India. The Supreme Court has denounced the theory that Art. 301 guarantees freedom “in the abstract and not of the individuals” (See <b>Dist. Collector, Hyderabad v. Ibrahim, 1970</b>).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Bapubhai v. State of Maharashtra, 1956 </b>Art. 301 could be invoked only when an individual is prevented from sending his goods across the State, or from one point to another in the same State, while Art. 19(1)(g) can be invoked when the complaint is with regard to the right of an individual to carry on business unrelated to, or irrespective of, the movement of goods. While Art. 301 contemplates the right of trade in motion, Art. 19(1)(g) secures the right at rest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1056087/" class="a" target="_blank">Further, Article 302 provides that Parliament may by law impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one state and another or within any part of the territory of India, as may be required in the public interest. The power to decide whether something is in the interest of the public or not is solely given to the Parliament. It can be seen as in the case of Surajmal Roopchand and Co v/s the State </a><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1056087/" target="_blank">of Rajasthan</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_of_India_Act_1915" class="a" target="_blank">(1967) were under </a>the Defence of India Rules, in the interest of the general public, restrictions were imposed on the movement of grain.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Is parliament can regulate trade and give preference to state</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1327219/" class="a" target="_blank">The power of the Parliament in Article 302 is kept in check by </a>Article 303. Article 303(1) states that the Parliament does not have the power to make any law which will keep one State at a more preferable position than the other State, by virtue of any entry in trade and commerce in any one of the lists in 7th Schedule. However, Clause (2) states that the Parliament can do so if it is proclaimed by law that it is essential to make such provisions or regulations, as there is indeed a scarcity of goods in some parts of the country.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Power of the state legislature to enact a law (Article 304(a))</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1392920/" class="a" target="_blank">Article </a><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1204286/" class="a" target="_blank">304(a) further says that the State should impose taxes on any goods transported/imported from other States if alike goods are taxed in the State too. It is done so that there is no discrimination between goods produced within the State and goods imported from some other states. In the case of State of Madhya Pradesh v/s Bhailal </a>Bhai,(1964) the State of Madhya Pradesh imposed taxes on imported tobacco which was not even subject to tax in the very own State i.e State of Madhya Pradesh. The Court disapproved of the tax statement that it was discriminatory in nature.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Power of state legislature on restriction on trade and commerce</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 304(2) guides the States to impose certain reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce, and intercourse as may suit the public interest. But no Bill or Amendment for such shall be put forward in the State Legislature without the prior approval of the President.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Saving of existing laws which are enacted before $th Constitutional Amendment</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per Article 305, Nothing in Article 301 shall affect the operation of any law made before the commencement of the Constitution <b>(Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955 </b>, in so far as it relates to, or <b>prevent Parliament or the Legislature of a State from making any law </b>relating to, any such matter as is referred to in sub clause (ii) of clause ( 6 ) of Article 19</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 307 under Part XIII permits the <b>Parliament to designate such authority as it deems fit </b>for carrying out the provisions laid down in Articles 301, 302, 303 and 304. The Parliament can also bestow such authorities with functions and powers as it feels are required.</p></body></html>
