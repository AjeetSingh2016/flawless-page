It acquires unitary features during an</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Emergency. Due to this reason, Dr B.R Ambedkar called the Indian Federal system</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">as unique because it <b>becomes entirely unitary during an Emergency</b>. During an Emergency, as Constitutional machinery fails, the system converts itself into a unitary feature. The framers of the Constitution felt that, in an emergency, the Centre should have overriding powers to control and direct all aspects of administration and legislation throughout the country</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It can be issued only in <b>exceptional circumstances </b>and not merely to keep an unpopular government in office as happened in June 1975 when an emergency was declared on the ground of internal disturbance without there being adequate justification for the same. To deal with this loophole Parliament in the year 1978 introduced <b>44th Constitutional Amendmen</b>t act especially Arts. 352 and 356 have been extensively amended by the Constitution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Part- XVIII of Indian Constitution deals with the Emergency provisions <span class="p">i.e. </span>Articles 352 to</h1><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">360<span class="p">.

Such a proclamation may be made in respect of the whole of India, or such part of the Indian territory as may be specified in the proclamation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Emergency provision and 44th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1978</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The term <b>‘Armed Rebillion’ was substituted to ‘Internal disturbance’ by 44th Constitutional Amendment Act 1978</b>. As the Supreme Court in <b>Naga People’s Movement of Human Rights v. Union of India, 1998 </b>explained , the expression “internal disturbance” has a wider connotation than “armed rebellion” in the sense that “<b>armed rebellion</b>” is likely to pose a threat to the security of the country, or a part thereof, while “internal</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">disturbance”, though serious in nature, <b>would not pose a threat to the security </b>of the country, or a part thereof.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The intention underlying the substitution of the words <b>‘internal disturbance’ </b>by the words <b>“armed rebellion</b>” is to limit the invocation of Art. 352 only to more serious situations where there is a threat to the security of the country, or a part thereof. The reason underlying restricting the scope of Art. 352 is proclamation of emergency under Art. 352 has <b>a very serious impact on the powers of the States </b>as well as the Fundamental Rights of the people.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">And as per Article 352(1) the Emergency can be restricted to Specific or specified territory means Proclamation need not to be extend to whole India. A proclamation issued under Art. 352(1) may be varied or revoked by a subsequent proclamation as per clause 2 of Article 352.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The 44th Amendment has introduced a <b>clause, v., Art. 352(3), </b>to the effect that the President shall not issue a proclamation of emergency [under Art. 352(1)], or a proclamation varying the same, unless the decision of the Union Cabinet (<b>that is to say, the Council consisting of the Prime Minister and other Ministers of Cabinet rank appointed under Art. 75) </b>that such a proclamation may be issued has been communicated to him in writing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This means that the decision to issue such a proclamation has to be arrived at collectively by the Cabinet and not by the Prime Minister alone without consulting the Cabinet. It so happened in <b>1975 that the President proclaimed emergency on the advice of the Prime Minister alone </b>and the Council of Ministers was later presented with a fait accompli. It is to avoid any such situation in future that <b>Art. 352(3) </b>has been introduced in the Constitution. As per Article 352(4) of the Constitution Every proclamation issued under Art. 352(1) is to be laid before each House of Parliament. It ceases to operate except when it is a proclamation revoking the <b>previous proclamation at the expiration of one month </b>unless, in the meantime, it has been approved by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament .</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Thus, the purport of Art. 352(1) is that Parliament must be convened within a month to consider the proclamation of emergency. If, however, at the time of the issue of the proclamation or thereafter, Lok Sabha is dissolved without approving the proclamation, and the Rajya Sabha approves it, then the <b>proclamation ceases to operate 30 days after the Lok Sabha </b>sits again after fresh elections, unless in the meantime the new Lok Sabha passes a resolution approving the proclamation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>Article 352(6) </b>that a resolution <b>approving the proclamation of emergency </b>(or one varying it) has to be passed by each House by a majority of the total membership of each House and <b>not less than two-thirds of the majority of the members </b>present and voting in each House. Once approved by Parliament, the proclamation remains in force, unless</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">revoked earlier, only for six months from the date of the passing of the later of the resolutions [Art. 352(5)]. For the continuance of the emergency beyond that period, parliamentary approval is needed again. Thus, each time Parliament approves the proclamation, its life is extended for six months [Proviso to Art. 352(5)]. In this way, the question whether the emergency should continue in force or not must periodically come before both Houses of Parliament.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Above Provision introduced by <b>44th constitutional Amendment </b>earlier once approved by the two Houses, the proclamation could remain in force as long as the executive desired. There was no provision for periodical parliamentary review of the need for continuance of the emergency. It may however be noted that the Central Executive can revoke the proclamation at any time it likes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>Article 352(7) </b>of constitution It was added by 44th constitutional Amendment act the President is obliged <b>to revoke a proclamation of emergency </b>issued under Art. 352(1) (or one varying the same) if the House of People passes a resolution disapproving the same <b>[Art. 352(7)]. </b>This resolution is to be passed by a simple majority of the members of the House present and voting. Formerly the power to revoke the proclamation vested in the executive and the House had no say in the matter. Now, t<b>he executive has to withdraw the emergency if the Lok Sabha so desires.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>Article 352(8) of Constitution </b>Where a notice in writing signed by not less than one-tenth of the total number of members of the House of the People has been given, of their <b>intention to move a resolution for disapproving</b>, or, as the case may be, for disapproving the continuance in force of, a Proclamation issued under clause (1) or a Proclamation varying such Proclamation,—</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="(a)"><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">to <b>the Speaker</b>, if the <b>House is in session</b>; or</p></li><li data-list-text="(b)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;text-align: left;">to the <b>President, </b>if <b>the House is not in session</b>,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">a special sitting of the House shall be held <b>within fourteen days from the date </b>on which such notice is received by the Speaker, or, as the case may be, by the President, for the purpose of considering such resolution. It was also added by <b>44th Constitutional Amendment act.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As per <b>Article 352(9) of constitution </b>the President has power to issue different</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">proclamations on different grounds, “<b>being war or external aggression, armed rebellion or imminent danger of war </b>or external aggression or armed rebellion whether or not there is a Proclamation already issued by the President under clause (1) and such Proclamation is in operation.”. This provision was introduced in 1975 by the 38th Amendment after the proclamation was issued on the ground of internal disturbance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">There was already in existence at the time a proclamation of emergency (issued in <b>1971) </b>on the ground of <b>external aggression</b>. The provision was to ensure that there might be no legal hurdle in the way of having two proclamations of emergency on two different grounds operating at one and the same time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Can judiciary can check over proclamation of emergency by presidents discretion</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Thus, the question whether the security of India is threatened or not lies within the subjective satisfaction of the President acting on the advice of the Cabinet. The question has arisen from time to time whether this satisfaction of the President is justiciable or not. In <b>Bhut Nath v. State of West Bengal</b>, the Supreme Court refusing to hold the continuance of the emergency under Art. 352 ‘void’ stated that the question is “<b>a political, not justiciable issue and the appeal should be to the polls and not to the courts</b>.”</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Legislation Regarding the same</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">To put the matter beyond any shadow of doubt, the Constitution (Thirty-eighth Amendment) Act, 1975 amended the Constitution by adding clause 5 to Art. 352 which declared that the “satisfaction” of the President mentioned in Art. 352(1) and (3) “shall be final and conclusive” and “shall not be questioned in any court on any ground.” It was</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">further declared that “neither the Supreme Court nor any other court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any question, on any ground, regarding the validity of—</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l3"><li data-list-text="(i)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">a declaration made by proclamation by the President to the effect stated in clause (1); or</p></li><li data-list-text="(ii)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">the continued operation of such proclamation.”</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The ‘<b>satisfaction</b>’ of the President in declaring the emergency, and, thus, the proclamation of emergency under Art. 352, were thus sought to be placed beyond the judicial scrutiny.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">But this particular legislation got overruled by <b>44th constitutional amendment </b>act has repealed <b>Article 352(5) </b>The position has thus been restored to what it was before the 38th Amendment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now the question arises here is judiciary can check the proclamation of Emergency</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Since the passa ge of the <b>Forty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution</b>, the question of judicial review of the discretion of the President to declare or not to declare an emergency has not arisen as no emergency has been declared after 1975. But in In <b>Minerva Mills, 1980</b></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">, <b>Justice Bhagwati</b>, did express the view that whether the President in proclaiming the emergency under Art. 352 had applied his mind, or whether he acted outside his powers, or acted mala fide in proclaiming the, emergency could <b>not be excluded from the scope of judicial review.</b></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Further after the Supreme Court decision in <b>SR Bommai case</b>, in which the Supreme Court did go into the validity of a proclamation issued by the President under Art. 356, it can now be safely asserted that a proclamation of emergency under Art. 352 is reviewable by the Court on the grounds mentioned by <b>BHAGWATI, J., in Minerva Mills</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Constitution seeks to control the exercise of power to proclaim an emergency in two ways:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l4"><li data-list-text="(i)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The President must act on the advice of the Central Cabinet and not in his own subjective satisfaction and also not on the advice of the Prime Minister alone. Thus, the effective power to declare an emergency lies with the Cabinet.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(ii)"><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The democratic control over the executive power in respect of proclaiming an emergency has been strengthened in so far as parliamentary approval is necessary for the proclamation immediately after it is made and, then, after every six months.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">“As per prof. MP Jain: A strong willed Prime Minister may have his way as he may dominate his Cabinet as well as the party and, thus, mobilise support for the emergency even though, in effect, there may be no need for the same.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Consequences of National Emergency</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The normal fabric of the Centre-State relations undergoes a fundamental change. Parliament becomes empowered to make a law with respect to any matter in the State List, and such a law operates till six months after the proclamation ceases to operate Art. 250(1) and (2) respectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 352(1) read with the article 359 provides for suspension of the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III during emergencies. But by the 44th constitutional amendment act 1978, the enforcement of the rights under Articles 20 and 21 cannot be suspended. It was also upheld in case <b>I.R. Coelho v.

As per article 83(2) the Lok Sabha may be extended beyond its normal five year period by Parliament by law for a year each time, up to a period not extending beyond six months after the proclamation of emergency ceases to operate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Imposition of Article 352 in post-constitutional periods</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Proclamation of National Emergency invoked three times so far:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l5"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">A proclamation of emergency was issued under Art. 352, for the first time, on <b>October 26, 1962</b>, in the wake of <b>conflict with China</b>.

Thus, from June 26, 1975, to March, 1977, two emergency proclamations were in force simultaneously.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The proclamation of 1975 on the ground of internal disturbance proved to be the most controversial. There was violation of the Fundamental Rights of the people on a large scale; <b>drastic press censorship was imposed</b>. A large number of persons were put in preventive detention. The reasons for imposing the emergency were explained by the Central Government in a White Paper, dated July 21, 1975, and the two Houses of Parliament approved the proclamation on the same day.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The general public perception was that issuing of this proclamation amounted to misuse of power on the part of the Central Government of the day insofar as there was no real emergency. The public reaction to the proclamation was so intense that when elections were held in 1977 for the Lok Sabha after the proclamation ceased to exist, the Congress Party, which was responsible for the proclamation, <b>lost its majority and the Janata Government came to power.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Janata Government appointed the <b>Shah Commission to probe into the circumstances which led to the declaration of the emergency in 1975</b>. This Commission in its report held that there was no evidence of any circumstances which could warrant the declaration of the emergency in 1975. There was no unusual event, or even a tendency in that direction, to justify the imposition of the emergency. There was no threat at all to the well-being of the nation from external or internal sources.
