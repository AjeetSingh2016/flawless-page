In the 21st century, females are not the only ones practicing this profession. Men and transgender persons are also involved in prostitution, although in lesser number than women. In the context of India, there is a mention of prostitution in the Rig Veda. In medieval India, the <b>Tawaifs served the nobility in dance, music and the likes</b>. This was a nascent form of prostitution, which later evolved into sexual favors for the common people. In the present era, this is called <b>Prostitution</b>. The most significant question that arises with respect to prostitution is whether its legalization is for the better or for the worst.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Currently, Austria, some states of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Belgium and Brazil have legalized prostitution. In India, prostitution is neither explicitly illegalized nor regulated. Associated work such as owning or working in a brothel, pimping, and organized sex work have been made illegal under <b>The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 (ITPA).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In <b>India prostitution is partially legal</b>. Prostitutes can practice the profession privately, but <b>solicitation and organized prostitution such as brothel keeping are illegal</b>. Prostitution can be practiced away from public spaces. The rate of prostitution is hard to determine because it is a shadowed profession, and institutions of prostitutions like brothels are rackets. Even though brothels are illegal per se, there is little effort made by the Government to track them down and bust the sex rackets. However, there are a few laws with respect to prostitution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It also contains the provisions for punishment in case the conditions are breached. <b>Bengal Suppression of Immoral Traffic Act, 1933 </b>by the Bengal government is also of similar nature as the ITPA. It imposes restrictions on prostitution in the state of Bengal.</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Contagious Diseases Act, 1868 <span class="p">(now repealed) was an act in Colonial India which aimed to regulate prostitutes to curb the spread of diseases within the British navy and army. It was repealed in 1886.

The primary source of information is the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 which lays down the definition of prostitution and provides the conditions under which prostitution can be practiced.

The Gujarat High Court in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">another case refused to recognize prostitution as a legitimate means of livelihood, as that would give an <b>open invitation for women to be trafficked </b>and also that the right to prostitution in not a fundamental right of women or girls (See <b>Sahyog Mahila Mandal v.

The Centre in 2016 told the SC that the panel&#39;s recommendations were incorporated in a draft legislation.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">However, no law has since been made.

The ruling mentions,  “The Press Council of India should be urged to issue <b>appropriate guidelines for the media to take utmost care not to reveal identities </b>of sex workers, during arrest, raid and rescue operations, whether as victims or accused and not to publish or telecast any photos that would result in the disclosure of such identities. Besides, the newly introduced <b>Section 354C, IPC, which makes voyeurism a criminal offence</b>, should</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">be strictly enforced against electronic media in order to prohibit telecasting photos of sex workers with their clients in the garb of capturing the rescue operation.” This directive clearly outlines that <b>voyeurism done by the state infringes upon the dignity of sex workers </b>and criminalises any such action. Yet, this point has hardly been the focus of any media article or public debate so far</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Regularized or banned</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">However, the debates in India seem to revolve around the dignity in sex work, its validity, and the social acceptance of sex work as a profession. As soon as various media outlets started reporting on the line of ‘sex work has been legalised’ (Firstpost, The Telegraph, Deccan Chronicle, India Today, etc.) a general standpoint by people looking to uphold the moral standards of society was that the ‘privileged’ feminists are making a furore about sex work being legalised wherein it should ideally be banned.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Arguments like <b>‘sex work cannot be a consensual profession’</b>, and ‘sex work is about the objectification of women’ has become the main go-to argument for naysayers in this case. Yet, almost everyone seems to the missing the point that this temporary ruling, which may very well be overturned in <b>6 weeks time, focuses not on legalisation but mostly on the protection of human rights and upholding the constitutional rights </b>guaranteed to every Indian citizen.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">And <b>Justice Verma commission </b>had also acknowledged that there is a distinction between <b>women who are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation </b>and adult, consenting <b>women who are in sex work of their own volition</b>.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ruling and Constitutional provisions</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/article-142" class="a" target="_blank">The court invoked its special powers under Article 142 of the </a>Constitution. Article 142 provides <b>discretionary power to the Supreme Court </b>as it states that the Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Therefore although the ambit of the power is wide it should “be limited to the short compass of the actual dispute before the court and not to what might reasonably be connected with or related to such matter” (See <b>Zahira Habibullah Sheikh v. State of Gujarat, (2004)).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per Prof. MP Jain “The jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court under Art. 142 are <b>supplementary in nature and are provided for doing complete justice </b>in any matter. In course of time, the Apex Court has given a much wider dimension and ambit to Art. 142, practically raising the provision to the status of a new source of substantive power for itself.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 142(1) contains no limitations regarding the causes or the circumstance in which the power can be exercised nor does it lay down any condition to be satisfied before such power is exercised. The exercise of the power is left completely to the discretion of the highest court. Referring to Art. 142(1), the Supreme Court in <b>Supreme Court Bar Association v.
