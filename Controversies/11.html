The Act was brought by the Congress government of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao at a time when the Babri Masjid was still standing. While introducing the bill in Parliament, then Home Minister <b>S B Chavan </b>said: “It is considered necessary <b>to adopt these measures in view of the controversies arising from time to time with regard to conversion of places of worship </b>which tend to vitiate the communal atmosphere… Adoption of this Bill will effectively <b>prevent any new controversies from arising in respect of conversion </b>of any place of worship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Provisions under Act</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The preamble of the Act says, “<i>An Act to prohibit conversion of any place of worship and to provide for the maintenance of the religious character of any place of worship as it existed on the 15th day of August, 1947, and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto</i>.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">‘Places of Worship<span class="p">’ defined under Section 2(c), means a temple, mosque, gurudwara, church, monastery </span>or any other place of public religious worship of any religious denomination <span class="p">or any section thereof, by whatever name called.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per Section 3, Put the <b>bar on conversion of Places of Worship</b>, No person shall convert <b>any place of worship of any religious denomination </b>or any section thereof into a place of worship of a <b>different section of the same religious denomination </b>or of a different religious denomination or any section thereof.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per Section 4(1), the religious character of a place of worship existing on the 15th day of August, 1947 <b>shall continue to be the same as it existed on that day</b>. Section 4(2) of the Act states that all litigations, appeals or other proceedings relating to changing the nature of the place of worship (which were pending till August 15, 1947) shall cease after the enactment of this Act and no fresh action can be taken on such cases.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">However, suits, appeals and legal proceedings <b>can be initiated with respect </b>to the conversion of the religious character of any place of worship after the commencement of the Act if the change of status took place <b>after the cut-off date of August 15, 1947.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per Section 4(3)(a), any place of worship referred to in sub-section (1) and subsection (2) which is an <b>ancient and historical monument or an archaeological site </b>or remains covered by the <b>Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958.</b></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Satinder Kumar and Ors. vs. Union of India</b>, a case about a Church in Shimla, the Himachal Pradesh High Court said <b>any structure that is more than 100 years old and satisfies the definition of ancient monument under the law</b>. Therefore, it falls outside the ambit of the Places of Worship Act.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per Section 5, “<b>Ram Janam Bhoomi</b>” is exempted from this Act stated “Nothing contained in this Act shall <b>apply to the place or place of worship commonly known as Ram Janma Bhumi-Babri Masjid situated in Ayodhya </b>in the State of Uttar Pradesh and to any suit, appeal or other proceeding relating to the said place or place of worship.”</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Supreme court on places of Worship Act, 1991</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">While delivering the <b>Ayodhya verdict in 2019</b>, the Supreme Court had referred to the Places of Worship Act and said that it <b>manifests the secular values </b>of the Constitution and strictly prohibits retrogression. &quot;In providing a guarantee for the preservation of the religious character of places of public worship <b>as they existed on 15 August 1947 </b>and against the conversion of places of public worship.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Parliament determined that independence from colonial rule furnishes a constitutional basis for healing the injustices of the past by <b>providing the confidence to every religious community </b>that their places of worship will be preserved and that their character will not be altered,&quot; the court said.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It further added: &quot;The law addresses itself to the State as much as to every citizen of the nation. Its norms bind those who govern the affairs of the nation at every level. Those norms implement the <b>Fundamental Duties under Article 51A </b>and are hence positive mandates to every citizen as well. The State, has by enacting the law, enforced a constitutional commitment and operationalized its constitutional <b>obligations to uphold the equality of all religions and secularism which is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution</b>.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Grounds of unconstitutionality of Places of Worship Act 1991</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Center by making the impugned Act has created <b>arbitrary irrational retrospective cutoff date, </b>declared that character of places of worship-pilgrimage shall be maintained as it was on <b>15.8.1947 </b>.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Pilgrimage is a <b>State subject [Entry-7, List-II,Schedule-7] </b>hence Centre neither can restrain Hindus, Jains, Budhists, Sikhs to take over the complete possession of their places of worship and pilgrimage through judicial process nor can make law to abridge their rights and particularly with retrospective effect</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">If suit/appeal/proceeding filed on ground that conversion of place of worship and pilgrimage has taken place <b>after 15.8.1947 and before 18.9.1991</b>, that shall be disposed off in terms of Section 4(1) they won’t be able to restore their places of worship and pilgrimage including temples-endowments in spirit of <b>Articles 25-26 </b>and illegal barbarian act of invaders will continue in perpetuity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The injury caused to Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs is extremely large because Sections 2, 3, 4 of the Act has <b>taken away the right to approach the Court and thus right to judicial remedy has been closed</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It not only contrary to <b>Articles 14, 15, 21, 25, 26 and 29 but also against the principle of secularism</b>, which is the part of Preamble and basic structure of the Constitution. Centre has transgressed its legislative power by barring remedy of judicial review which is basic feature of the Constitution. <b>Apex Court has reiterated that judicial review </b>cannot be taken away.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Apex Court, in a catena of decisions has held <b>that right to judicial remedy cannot be taken away by State and power of courts</b>, and particularly constitutional courts conferred under <b>Article 32 and 226 cannot be frustrated </b>and such denial has been held violative of basic structure of the Constitution and beyond legislative power.</p></body></html>
