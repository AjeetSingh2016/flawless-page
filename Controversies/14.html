Historically, the influence of religious institutions was instrumental in shaping the legal stance favoring the criminalization of suicidal attempts. After the French Revolution, along with other socio-cultural changes in Europe, the attitude towards suicide and attempted suicide gradually started to change. During 19th and 20th century, most of the developed countries have repealed criminalization of attempted suicide, but some countries including India, continue to treat suicidal attempt as a criminal offense.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In our country, attempt to suicide is an offence punishable under section 309 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 309 reads thus:</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As per <b>section 309 - Attempt to commit suicide</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">“Whoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the commission of such offence, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine, or with both.”</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Article 21 of the Constitution of India enjoins that <b>no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty </b>except according to procedure established by law.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">A Division Bench of the Supreme Court in <b>P. Rathinam v. Union of India, 1994 </b>held that the right to live of which Article 21 speaks of can be said to bring in its trail the right not to live a forced life, and therefore, <b>Section 309 violates Article 21.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">This decision was, however, subsequently overruled in <b>Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab </b>by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, holding that Article 21 cannot be construed to include within it the <b>‘right to die’ as a part of the fundamental right </b>guaranteed therein, and therefore, it cannot be said that section 309 is violative of Article 21.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In its <b>42nd Report submitted in 1971, the Commission recommended</b>, inter alia, repeal of section 309. The Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 1978, as passed by the Rajya Sabha, accordingly provided for omission of section 309. Unfortunately, before it could be passed by the Lok Sabha, the Lok Sabha was dissolved and the Bill lapsed. The Commission submitted its <b>156th Report in 1997 after the pronouncement of the judgement </b>in Gian Kaur, recommending retention of Section 309.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">The Supreme Court in Gian Kaur focused on constitutionality of section 309. It did not go into the wisdom of retaining or continuing the same in the statute.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In view of the views expressed by the World Health Organization, the International Association for Suicide Prevention, France, the <b>decriminalization of attempted suicide </b>by all countries in <b>Europe and North America</b>, the opinion of the Indian Psychiatric Society, and the representations received by the Commission from various persons, the Commission has resolved to recommend to the Government to initiate steps for repeal of the anachronistic law contained in section 309, IPC, which would relieve the distressed of his suffering. It needs mention here that only a handful of countries in the world, like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore and India have persisted with this undesirable law.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Throughout history, suicide has been both condemned and commended by various societies. Since the Middle Ages, society has used first the canonic and later the criminal law to combat suicide. Following the French Revolution of 1789 criminal penalties for attempting to commit suicide were abolished in European countries, England being the last to follow suit in 1961.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In England, the <b>Suicide Act 1961 abrogated the law laying down that attempt to commit suicide is an offence</b>. Although suicide is no longer an offence in itself, any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide of another, or an attempt by another to commit suicide, is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">term which may extend to 14 years. In India, not only abetment of suicide is an offence (vide section 306, IPC), but also attempt to commit suicide is an offence (vide section 309, IPC).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Suicide is one of the important factors contributing to <b>premature or unnatural end of precious human lives</b>. It is a global problem and the World Health Organization has in regard to attempted suicide expressed the view that punishing with imprisonment a behaviour consequent to either a mental disorder or a social difficulty gives completely a wrong message to the population, and that the WHO encourages efforts for the prevention of suicide.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The <b>International Association for Suicide Prevention </b>has also expressed the view that attempted suicide <b>should be decriminalized and that suicidal individuals </b>need to be helped and imprisonment only makes their problems worse. The said Association on September 10 every year sponsors ‘World Suicide Prevention Day’ as a part of its efforts to achieve effective suicide prevention.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The constitutionality of section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 has been the subject matter of challenge several times before the Supreme Court and High Courts.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Article 14 of the Constitution provides for equality before law and reads as under: “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.”</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Article 21 of the Constitution provides for protection of life and personal liberty and reads as under: “No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">It will be apposite to first note the following observation of the Delhi High Court in <b>State v. Sanjay Kumar Bhatia</b>, a case under section 309, IPC:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">“A young man has allegedly tried to commit suicide presumably because of over emotionalism. It is ironic that Section 309 I.P.C. still continues to be on our Penal Code. The result is that a young boy driven to such frustration so as to seek one’s own life would have escaped human punishment if he had succeeded but is to be hounded by the police, because attempt has failed.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Strange paradox that in the age of votaries of Euthanasia, suicide should be criminally punishable. Instead of the society hanging its head in shame that there should be such social strains that a young man (the hope of tomorrow) should be driven to suicide compounds its inadequacy by treating the boy as a criminal.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Instead of sending the young boy to psychiatric clinic it gleefully sends him to mingle with criminals, as if trying its best to see that in future he does fall foul of the punitive sections of the Penal Code. The continuance of <b>Section 309 I.P.C. </b>is an anachronism unworthy of a human society like ours. Medical clinics for such social misfits certainly but police and prisons never.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The very idea is revolting. This concept seeks to meet the challenge of social strains of modern urban and competitive economy by ruthless suppression of mere symptoms – this attempt can only result in failure. Need is for humane, civilized and socially oriented outlook and penology. Many penal offences are the offshoots of an unjust society and socially decadent outlook of love between young people being frustrated by false consideration of code, community or social pretensions. No wonder so long as society refuses to face this reality its coercive machinery will invoke the provision like Section 309 I.P.C. which has no justification right to continue remain on the statute book.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The constitutional validity of Section 309 was initially struck down as a cruel and irrational provision and violative of art 21 of the Constitution, in the case of <b>P Rathinam v Union of India </b>.However, In <b>Gian Kaur v State of Punjab </b>, the P Rathinam dictum was reversed and a Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of Section 309, by indicating that it <b>does not violate arts 14, 19 and 21 </b>of the Constitution. It held that ‘<b>the right to life&#39; </b>under art 21 of the Constitution does not include the <b>&#39;right to die&#39;</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">As stated earlier, intention to commit suicide is essential in order to constitute an offence under this section. As per <b>State of Andhra Pradesh v Rayavarappu Punnayya,1977  </b>Where an accused jumped into a well to avoid the police and later came out of the well of his own accord, it was held that in the absence of evidence that he jumped into the well to commit suicide, he could not be convicted of the offence under this section 81.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Announcement of hunger strikes <span class="p">is a common scenario in India. Very often, these hunger strikes are resort-ed to as a means to pressurise some authority to concede demands of the hunger strikers. So, generally speaking, </span>the intention of a person on a hunger striker is not to kill himself<span class="p">, but, to the contrary, very often it is done for </span>improvement, advancement or amelioration <span class="p">of some situation. In view of this, the essential requirement of the offence, namely, the intention to kill oneself, is absent and hence, it cannot amount to an offence under this section.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">As per <b>Hari Singh Gour, Penal Law of India, vol 3, 11th edn</b>.  Thus, only in cases where the accused intends to persevere to the end, refuses all nourishment and reaches such a stage that there is imminent danger of death ensuing, can he be held guilty of the offence of attempt to commit suicide. Even Prime Minster Narendra modi himself has said “<b>Suicide attempt victims need counselling not punishment</b>”</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Steps to decriminalize the section 309 of IPC</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Eventually, it was included in a few sections of the recently drafted Mental Health Care Bill 2013 which has recently been introduced to Rajya Sabha, and is still pending an approval before it can take effect as a law. Some experts are of the opinion that the Indian Penal Code should be amended through a separate bill, and <b>not under Mental Health Care Bill and now become an act by the assent of the president in 2017.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Parliament has now enacted the Mental Health care Act, 2017 which vide section 115 lays down that:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="(1)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Notwithstanding anything contained in section 309 of the Indian Penal Code any person <b>who attempts to commit suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under the said Code.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(2)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The appropriate Government shall have a duty <b>to provide care, treatment and rehabilitation to a person, </b>having severe stress and who attempted to commit suicide, to reduce the risk of recurrence of attempt to commit suicide. In view of the above provisions, if a person attempts to commit suicide, it shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, that he has severe stress and <b>he shall not be tried and punished under section 309 of the IPC, 1860.</b></p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">By inverting the presumption against guilt but retaining the provision in the statute book, attempt to suicide is still a criminal offence. In order to render conviction, prosecution will be required to lead evidence and prove that the survivor did not have severe stress and did not suffer any issue of mental health.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Some sections of the proposed mental health care bill which are relevant for<span class="h1"> </span>decriminalization include</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Section 124 <span class="p">of the bill describes about the decriminalization of the ‘</span>attempt to commit</h1><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">suicide’</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 124 (1) recognizes person who has attempted to commit suicide is exempted from punishment under the I.P.C as presumed to be <b>‘suffering from a mental illness unless</b></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">proven otherwise’</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 124 (2) recognizes the suffering being undergone by a person who attempt suicide and <b>seeks to provide them with care and consideration</b>, instead of subjecting them to criminal prosecution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mental health care and Budget</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In our country, where mental illness is considered equal to depression, the obvious financial burden on government will be too high. For the financial year 2017–2018, the proposed health expenditure of <b>1.2% of gross domestic product in India</b>. It is among the lowest in the world and the public health expenditure has consistently declined since 2013–2014. India spends <b>0.06% of its health budget on mental health care</b>, which is significantly less than what <b>Bangladesh spends (0.44%). </b>Most developed nations spend <b>above 4% of their budgets on mental health research, </b>infrastructure, frameworks, and workforce, according to 2011 WHO report. Ironically, India continues to follow the archaic law even though Britain itself had decriminalized suicide way back in 1961.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Note<span class="p">- It is to be noted that the abetting of the commission of suicide (but not the abetting of attempt to commit suicide) is covered under </span>Section 306 IPC <span class="p">and the abetment of suicide of a child is covered under Section 305 IPC.

For example, In Rwanda, a person who engages in nonfatal suicidal behavior is liable, on conviction, to a 2-5 year prison sentence. In Uganda, non-fatal suicidal behavior is a felony punishable by up to 2 years imprisonment. In <b>Ghana Criminal Code (Act 29, 1960), non-fatal suicidal behavior is considered a crime.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In the <b>South Asian region</b>, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh are among the countries that continue to criminalize the suicidal attempt. In Singapore, a person who attempts suicide can be imprisoned for up to one year. Additionally, North Korea also <b>criminalizes suicide with a peculiar deterrent</b>, where the family and relatives of the suicide victim might be penalized as a form of collective punishment for the act of suicide</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Countries with Decriminalization of Suicides</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Countries that have decriminalized attempted suicide have continued to criminalize the abetment to suicide, suicide pacts and at times, deliberate self-harm.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In the <b>Australian state of Victoria</b>, the survivor of a suicide pact can be charged with manslaughter and abetting other person&#39;s suicide. In New Zealand, the abetment of the suicides of others is a crime and similarly in Russia, inciting someone to suicide is punishable by up to 5 years in prison. Attempted suicide has been decriminalized in Ireland as early as 1993, but self-harm is not seen as a form of attempted suicide. Suicide and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">attempted suicide are not crimes under the Roman-Dutch law. Some of the states (Alabama, Oregon and South Carolina) of U.S. continue to have laws against suicide pacts, aiders and abettors, and for insurance purposes. Only a few countries from South Asia, which include Srilanka, Indonesia, Maldives and Thailand do not treat attempted suicide as a crime.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Currently, World Health Organization <b>identified 59 countries </b>across the world that have decriminalized suicide. As seen from above, the attempted suicide has been decriminalized in whole of Europe, North America, much of South America and few parts of Asia.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Decriminalization of suicidal attempt occurred relatively late in countries which were influenced by the English common law. Similarly, the legal and coroners involvement in suicide certification tends to be much higher in these countries compared to the continental <b>Europe and Scandinavian region </b>where doctors are allowed to certify suicidal deaths without recourse to legal authorities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Arguments against Decriminalization of Suicide is valid</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Two major kind of arguments are generally put forth for criminalization of suicidal attempts, though in contemporary political and sociocultural times, these have been challenged.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The first major argument is rooted in the religious belief that <b>only God should have the right to dictate the end of life of a person </b>and when a person attempts to end the life himself or herself, it should be considered as a sinful act. Traditionally, suicide has been condemned by religions across the world. In some ethnic groups, the suicidal deaths are kept devoid of the customary funeral rituals. In <b>Hinduism</b>, it is believed that death by <b>suicide do not lead to achievement of salvation (moksha).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In general, suicidal death is associated with bringing dishonor to the entire lineage, social stigma and other consequences. But at the same time, many religions have also hailed</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">suicide as necessary in certain situations or circumstances. The ancient Hindu living principles <b>sanctioned some suicides such as, to expiate sins such as incest</b>, those suffering from <b>incurable disease and unable to perform their religious duties</b>, ‘sati’ (a once-culturally sanctioned practice where widow commits suicide by jumping in the burning pyre of dead husband).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Similarly many Rajput women from India chose death over humiliation in the aftermath of war. <b>Jainism have approved of the practice of ending one&#39;s life by one&#39;s own act in certain circumstances (Sallekhana), </b>while condemning it in other circumstances. The attitude of Buddhism has been ambiguous, though it has encouraged altruistic suicide under certain circumstances.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Another major argument for criminalization is the belief that law can act as a deterrent against other such attempts in the society. However, it is still not clear whether having a law to prosecute suicide attempters indeed acts as a deterrent or not.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before and after decriminalization</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Internationally, the research on the impact of repeal of anti-suicide legislation has yielded mixed results. In 1992, Lester compared suicide rates in Canada in the 10-year periods before and after decriminalization of suicide, and found no increase in the rate of suicide following decriminalization. Similarly, no change was observed in the New Zealand during the decade before or after decriminalization [Lester (1993)].As compared the suicide rates in seven countries (Canada, England and Wales, Finland, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, and Sweden) 5 years prior and 5 years following decriminalization, with an increase in the suicide rates after decriminalization of suicide.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Issues and challenges in road to decriminalize offence</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Even if the proposed Mental Health Care Bill is implemented as a law in near future in India, some issues need to be deliberated in more detail. Section 124 states t<b>hat the person may</b></p><h1 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">be exempt from ‘punishment’ and not ‘prosecution’. <span class="p">A possibility will remain that the police can remand a person who attempted suicide in custody and produce before a magistrate since the presumption of the law is that the ‘person with attempted suicide has a mental illness.’ </span>Magistrate has powers (under Section 111 of the Bill<span class="p">) to see that any person with mental illness is conveyed to a public mental health establishment for assessment/treatment for up to ten days.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Therefore, the persons with attempted suicide <b>may continue hesitate in seeking medical treatment after a suicidal attempt</b>, because of perceived fear of possible institutionalization against their own will. Other issues related to possible misuse of above provision may arise e.g. in case of victims of attempted suicide in the background of domestic violence. Whether the <b>decriminalization of suicidal attempts should be done through a separate amendment (rather than as part of mental health care bill) </b>with more careful consideration of various relevant issues which may arise in the context of suicide attempts, remains open to debate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">With a shift in official position from ‘legal’ to a ‘medical’ model of attempted suicide, an important challenge from a policy perspective will be to provide an access to mental health care for all those with attempted suicide. <b>Patients presenting with an attempted suicide should be advised for a psychiatric consultation </b>in all cases. In this context, there is a tremendous need to allocate the necessary resources for strengthening the primary mental health care services in all districts of the country.</p></body></html>
