In the Indian context, <b>patriarchy and religious, traditional and cultural practices </b>are more commonly used as instruments to justify and perpetrate violence against women in family settings. Violence against women is also linked to inequalities based on factors like <b>economic position of women in society</b>. Women’s subjugation is the result of the hierarchies that are maintained by or reflected in the institutions and structures involved in creating, maintaining, and normalizing violence against women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As per <b>Section 498-A of IPC</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Explanation- For the purposes of this section, &quot;<b>cruelty means</b>&quot;-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="(a)"><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">any wilful conduct which is <b>of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide </b>or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (<b>whether mental or physical</b>) of the woman; or</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(b)"><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any <b>unlawful demand for any property </b>or <b>valuable security </b>or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.]</p></li></ol><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">National Crime Report Bureau</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>National Crime Record Bureau 2012</b>, Violence occurring in a private setting is broadly covered within the scope of <b>Domestic Violence</b>. Domestic violence is one of the most prevalent forms of gender-based violence. According to crime statistics in India, cruelty by husband and relatives accounts for <b>44% of the total crime </b>committed against women. The recognition of domestic violence as a violation of human rights is a recent advance in international law.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The <b>Convention of Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), </b>which was formulated as an international bill of rights for women in 1979, did not explicitly address the issue of Violence against Women. The World Plan of Action adopted by the first World Conference on Women in Mexico in 1975 did not refer explicitly to violence, but drew attention to the need for the family to ensure <b>dignity, equality and security of each of its members.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Brief History of Domestic Violence in India</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Until the year 1983, <b>domestic violence against wives was not punishable in India</b>; although husbands or in-laws could be charged under the general penal provisions under the Indian Penal Code pertaining to murder, abetment to suicide, causing grievous hurt and wrongful confinement. Since these provisions applied equally to strangers, the specifics of the domestic situation of the women were ignored. Women, therefore, found it extremely difficult to prove violence <b>“beyond reasonable doubt” </b>or produce witnesses to corroborate their story, as required by the law. The demand for criminal law reform came about largely because of the large number of women that were dying in their matrimonial homes due to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">dowry-related harassment. In the 1980s, women&#39;s rights organizations across the country pressurized the <b>Criminal Law Amendment Committee (1982) </b>and urged the government to provide legislative <b>protection to women against domestic violence and dowry</b>, so that the victim could get justice while she was still alive. As a result of the intense campaigning and lobbying, significant amendments were made in the <b>Indian Penal Code, the Indian Evidence Act and the Dowry Prohibition Act</b>, with the intention of protecting women from marital violence, abuse and dowry demands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The most important amendment came in the form of the introduction of <b>Sec.498-A in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in 1983, </b>closely followed by <b>Sec.304B in IPC </b>1986, which defined the special offence of dowry-related death of a woman. It is believed that Sec.498-A and Sec.304-B were introduced to complement each other and be part of a scheme, since Sec.304-B addresses the particular offence of dowry death and Sec.498-A sought to address the wide-scale violence against married women for dowry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Section 498-A of IPC</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Under this section, offenders are liable for imprisonment as well as a fine and the offence is non-bailable, non-compoundable and cognizable on a complaint made to the police officer by the victim or by designated relatives. Sec.498-A passed by Indian Parliament in 1983…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Protection only for Married Women</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Sec. 498-A can only be invoked by <b>a wife, a daughter-in-law or their relatives</b>. This section is non-bailable (which means one has to appear in court and get bail from the judge), non-compoundable (the complaint cannot be withdrawn) and cognizable (arrests can be made without investigation or warrants). So far as the Indian Penal Code is concerned, Sec. 498-A</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">of IPC was introduced wherein if a woman was subjected to cruelty by her husband or his relative(s), he/they could be convicted under this penal provision. The law underwent further change with the introduction of section 304-B in the Penal Code and S. 113B in the Evidence Act, 1872 by the <b>Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 1986</b>. By way of introducing <b>Sections 113A and 113B </b>in the Evidence Act, the legislature has tried to permit a presumption to be raised if certain facts are established.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cruelty under Section 498-A IPC, 1860</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Cruelty has not been defined in any other section or any other statute other than Section 498-A of IPC. The definition of cruelty consists of two parts. <b>Subsection (b) concerns itself with the harassment on account of dowry demand</b>, while <b>subsection (a) takes care of cruelty for reasons other than dowry demands. </b>Under subsection (a) of section 498-A, in order to constitute cruelty, it is not enough that the conduct of the <b>accused is wilful and is offensively unjust to the woman</b>, but it is also necessary that the degree of such conduct on the part of the accused is such <b>as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide</b>, or such conduct is likely <b>to cause grave injury or danger to her life or limb </b>or to her <b>mental or physical health. </b>A reasonable apprehension of such conduct or the intention on the part of one to injure another is also an essential element of cruelty.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Krishna Lal &amp; Ors. v. Union of India &amp; Ors.</b>, the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana had to consider the proposition Contention raised whether the classification of the husband and his relatives for the purposes of Sec.498 was discriminatory and violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India or not?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It was further contended that the definition of the word <b>&quot;cruelty&quot; in Sec.498</b>-<b>A </b>was vague. The Court came to the conclusion that the husband and his relatives form a distinct class by themselves and that it amounted to <b>reasonable classification</b>, especially when the married woman was treated with cruelty within the four walls of the house of her husband and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">when there was no likelihood of any evidence available. Consequently, Sec.498-A was held to be non-violating of Article 14 of the Constitution Similarly, it was held that there was no vagueness in the definition of the word &quot;cruelty&quot; appearing in Sec.498-A having regard to the two clauses dealing with <b>&#39;wilful conduct&#39; </b>of the husband and/or <b>harassment to the married woman.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As cruelty had not been defined either in any Indian or in English law, and thus all the law on cruelty was judge-made law, its scope was kept open as the type and manner of cruelty changed with time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Chiding a woman occasionally for a mistake made by her may not per se amount to cruelty<span class="p">, but continuous taunting, insulting and scolding a woman on a false/flimsy pretext clearly falls within the definition of cruelty as specified under Sec. 498-A. Cruelty is not restricted to physical cruelty; </span>mental cruelty is also within its fold<span class="p">.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>State of West Bengal v. Orilal Jaiswal and Another</b>, the deceased was called a woman of evil luck as her father-in-law died shortly after the marriage. Her husband would also beat her whenever he would come home drunk. She was also told at times that items she had brought in dowry were of inferior quality. The Court ruled that all these amounted to mental cruelty. That is to say that Sec. 498-A is not restricted to dowry harassment alone. It also includes other forms of cruelty as defined under the Section although one may be overlapped by another.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is not necessary that the husband or his relatives must be present at the time when the housewife is subjected to cruelty. If their act or conduct, omission or commission is of such a nature which results in mental and physical harassment, it will amount to an act of cruelty to a woman whether at her matrimonial or at her natal family home. As seen in the case of <b>Jagdish v. State of Rajasthan,1998 </b>the offence under Sec. 498-A is a continuing offence</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">and if the act of cruelty continues even while the woman is living with her natal family, the offence can be tried by both the Courts in whose territorial jurisdiction the act of continuing offence of cruelty has been committed, be it at her matrimonial home or her parents’ house.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>State of U.P. vs. Santosh Kumar and Ors, 2009 </b>where the Supreme Court has stated that Sections304-B and 498-A IPC are both distinct and separate offences <b>where &#39;cruelty&#39; is a common essential ingredient of both the offences</b>. Under Sec.304-B, it is the &#39;dowry death&#39; that is punishable and death of the wife should take place within seven years of the marriage. In the statute, the timeframe of seven years is not a prerequisite in Sec. 498- A IPC; the husband or his relative would be punished for subjecting the woman to &#39;cruelty&#39; any time after the marriage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Once again this question came into consideration in the case of <b>Arun Garg vs. State of Punjab,2004 </b>reported much later in which the Hon’ble Court held that “Sections 304-B and 498-A of IPC are not mutually exclusive. They deal with different and distinct offences. In both the sections, <b>“cruelty” is a common element</b>. Under Sec. 498-A however, cruelty by itself amounts to an offence and is punishable. Under Sec. 304-B, it is the dowry death that is punishable and such death must have occurred within seven years of the marriage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">No such period is mentioned in Sec. 498-A. Moreover, a person charged and acquitted under Sec. 304-B can be convicted under Sec. 498-A without a specific charge being there, if such a case is made out.” In the instant case, the learned Session Judge apart from sentencing the accused to an imprisonment of up to 10 years under Sec. 304-B, also imposed a fine to the tune of Rs. 2,000/-. The Hon’ble Supreme Court came out strongly on the order of the lower court, clarifying that it was not empowered to impose fine as a punishment under Sec. 304-B.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Misuse of Section 498A of IPC</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Indian judiciary, right from the trial court upto the apex level has expressed concern over the <b>matter of misuse of Sec. 498-A I.P.C </b>in its recent judgments. In all, the institutional response to Sec. 498-A I.P.C has been that women are “misusing the law”. In the case of <b>Savitri Devi vs. Ramesh Chand</b>, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court had categorically stated that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">the provision has been misused to “…such an extent that it is hitting at the foundation of</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">marriage itself and has proved to be not so good for the health of the society at large”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In the same judgment, the court had recommended to the authorities to review Sec. 498-A, that court was of opinion that “thousands of marriages have been sacrificed at the altar of this provision”. In <b>Sushil Kumar Sharma vs. Union of India, 2005 </b>the Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that “…it is necessary for the Legislature to find out ways how the makers of frivolous complaints or allegations can be appropriately dealt with”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why do people misuse provision Section 498A -</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per investigative report by a NGO called <b>Rakshak</b>, - ‘The Silent Tears of Shattered Families: The Ugly Reality of Dowry Law’ -</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are certain specific reasons stated below:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="a."><h1 style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Legal Extortion <span class="p">– Get-rich-quick-scheme to extort large amounts of money.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="b."><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Prior Relationship <span class="p">– Wife has a prior relationship, and cannot get out of it.

The recommendation of the Law Commission in the 154th Report was reiterated in the 177th Report in 2001. Furthermore, in 2003, to add meat to its argument to make the provision compoundable, <b>Dr. Justice V.S.
