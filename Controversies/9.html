In <b>Munir, (1925</b>) “Connivance is a figurative term that means a voluntary indifference to any act or conduct that is taking place, to something that is going on before the eyes, or to something that is perceived to be going on without any complaint or intention to interrupt or interfere with it.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(C)"><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Adultery should not constitute a Rape</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The very nature of the crime of adultery implies that the consenting adults have sexual intercourse.

The society abhors marital infidelity. However, this object does not find favour with the Supreme Court. In </a>Joseph Shine, the Court observed thus:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">“… <i><b>the ostensible object, as pleaded by the State, being to protect and preserve the sanctity of marriage, is not, in fact, the object of Section 497 at all </b></i>…”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">It was further observed that the sanctity of marriage can be utterly destroyed by <b>a married man having sexual intercourse with an unmarried woman </b>or a widow which is not penalised by the legislature. Also, if the husband consents or connives at the sexual intercourse that amounts to adultery, <b>the offence is not committed</b>, thereby showing that it is not sanctity of marriage which is sought to be protected and preserved, but a proprietary right of a husband.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">History of Adultery</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 497 is a pre-constitutional law which was enacted in 1860. At that point of time, women had no rights independent of their husbands, and were treated as chattel or</p><h1 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">“property” of their husbands<span class="p">. Hence, the offence of adultery was treated as an injury to the husband, since it was considered to be </span>a “theft” of his property<span class="p">, for which he could proceed to prosecute the offender.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The first draft of the IPC released by the <b>Law Commission of India in 1837 </b>did not include <b>“adultery” as an offence</b>. Lord Macaulay was of the view that adultery or <b>marital infidelity </b>was a private wrong between the parties, and not a criminal offence. The views of Lord Macaulay were, however, overruled by the other members of the Law Commission, <b>Joseph Shine v.

It treats her as the property of man and totally subservient to the will of the master. It is a reflection of the social dominance that was prevalent when the penal provision was drafted, <b>Joseph Shine v. Union of India, 2018.</b></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Section 497 violates Articles 14 [Equality before law]</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Section 497 treats men and women unequally, as women are not subject to prosecution for adultery, and women cannot prosecute their husbands for adultery. Additionally, if there is <b>“consent or connivance” of </b>the husband of a woman who has committed adultery, no offence can be established. The section lacks an adequately determining principle to <b>criminalise consensual sexual activity and is manifestly arbitrary </b>and therefore violative of Article 14, <b>Joseph Shine v.

The rationale of the provision suffers from the absence of logicality of approach and therefore it suffers from the vice of <b>Article 14 </b>of the Constitution being manifestly arbitrary, <b>Joseph Shine v. Union of India, 2018.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Violation of Article 15(1) [Prohibition of discrimination]</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Article 15(1) prohibits the State from discriminating on grounds only of sex. A husband is considered an aggrieved party by the law if his wife engages in sexual intercourse with another man, <b>but the wife is not, if her husband does the same</b>. Viewed from this angle, the offence of adultery discriminates between a married man and a married woman to her <b>detriment on the ground of sex only</b>. The provision is discriminatory and therefore, violative of Article 15(1), <b>Joseph Shine v. Union of India, 2018.</b></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Violation of dignity of woman and Article 21 [Right to life]</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Dignity of the individual is a facet of Article 21.

Though granted immunity from prosecution, a woman is forced to <b>consider the prospect of the penal action that will attach upon the individual </b>with whom she engages in a sexual act. To ensure the fidelity of his spouse, the man is given the power to invoke the criminal sanction of the State. In effect, her spouse is empowered to curtail her sexual agency, <b>Joseph Shine v.

In doing so, it perpetuates the notion that a woman consents to a limited autonomy on entering marriage. The enforcement of forced female fidelity by <b>curtailing sexual autonomy is an affront to the fundamental right </b>to dignity and equality, <b>Joseph Shine v.

In any democracy, constitutional morality requires the assurance of certain rights <b>that are indispensable for the free</b>, <b>equal, and dignified existence </b>of all members of society. A commitment to constitutional morality requires enforcement of the constitutional guarantees of equality before the law, non-discrimination on account of sex, and dignity, all of which are affected by the operation of Section 497. <b>Joseph Shine v. Union of India, 2018</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Premised on sexual stereotypes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Section 497 is premised upon sexual stereotypes that view women as being passive and devoid of sexual agency. The notion that women are <b>‘victims’ of adultery and therefore </b>require the <b>beneficial exemption has been deeply </b>criticized by feminist scholars, who argue that such an understanding of the position of women is demeaning and fails to recognize them as equally autonomous individuals in society, <b>Joseph Shine v.

As per <b>Chandra Mohini Srivastava v Avinash Prasad Srivastava, 1967 </b>The fact that the husband cohabited with his wife even after coming to know that she has been guilty of cohabiting with another person is sufficient to constitute condonation.</p></body></html>
