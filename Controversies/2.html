      The AFSPA continues to be used by the Government of India in the
      insurgency ridden areas. As justified ever since by parliamentarians
      <b>that Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 </b>is an effective
      <b>counter terrorism law in India</b>. Initially, the Act was applicable
      to handle problems in
      <b>Northeastern region of the Union to the states of Assam and Manipur </b
      >to eradicate militancy amongst the Nagas.

      The vagueness of this definition was challenged in
      <b>Indrajit Barua v. State of Assam </b>case. The court decided that the
      <b>lack of precision </b>to the definition of a disturbed area was not an
      issue because the government and people of
      <b>India understand its meaning</b>. However, since the
      <b>declaration depends on the satisfaction of the Government official</b>,
      the declaration that an area is disturbed is not subject to judicial
      review. So in practice, it is only the government&#39;s understanding
      which <b>classifies an area as disturbed. </b>But in same case Hon’ble Court contended that, The Governor is empowered to declare any
      area of the State as “disturbed area’. It could not be arbitrary on ground
      of absence of legislative guidelines.

      There is no mechanism for the people to challenge this opinion. But
      strangely it is Defined under

      The provision is clearly violative of the Right to life and personal
      liberty granted under Article 21 of the constitution. If the military
      personnel shoot to kill just by the reason that they were of such an
      opinion, then the personal liberty of the people comes under great threat.
      This feature of the act is by no way a ‘<b>due process of law’ </b>which
      can be used as a defense against the deprivation of the right to life The term ‘procedure established by the law’ is synonymous to ‘a due process’

      one of the offenses listed <b>in section 4(a) of the AFSPA</b>. Moreover

      carrying of weapons, ammunition or explosive substances, none of which are

      Even if the person has joined such unlawful assembly armed with a deadly

      Moreover, persisting or joining in an unlawful assembly of five or more
      persons is also punishable with six months imprisonment, or a fine, or
      both. The same offence committed by someone in a disturbed area under the

      The Committee was tasked with the review of the AFSPA. It considered
      whether any amendments needed to be made to the Act to give it a more
      humane character or whether there was a need to replace the entire Act
      with a new and more liberal Act. The Committee recommended that

        class="a"

      <b>any deployment beyond 6 months would require Parliament’s approval</b>.

        2012 </b
      >The report included comments on sexual offences committed in conflict
      zones. It said that
      <b>sexual offences were legitimized by means of the AFSPA</b>. It
      recommended that armed forces be tried under ordinary legal code, and
      therefore the training and monitoring of personnel be
      <b>re-oriented to affect the difficulty of sexual offences</b>. The
      continuance of Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) in conflict areas
      needs to be revisited. At present, the AFSPA requires a sanction by the
      central government for initiating prosecution against armed forces
      personnel.

      The Committee has recommended that the requirement of sanction for
      prosecution of armed forces personnel should be specifically
      <b>excluded when a sexual offence is alleged. </b>Complainants of sexual
      violence must be afforded witness protection. Special  commissioners
      <b>should be appointed in conflict areas to monitor and prosecute </b>for
      sexual offences. Training of armed personnel should be reoriented to
      emphasise strict observance of orders in this regard by armed personnel.
