But there was a popular demand by the residents of Delhi as well as by various political parties in India that they should give statehood to Delhi. However, some part of the society disagrees with this proposition because it will </span>create a situation where the power to govern Delhi will be concentrated at two levels, <span class="p">one at the centre and one at Union Territory.

The report of the committee said that Delhi belongs to the nation as a whole, but it is also inhabited by its own people. The report <b>rejected the popular demand of giving statehood to Delhi </b>because doing so will give Delhi a disproportionate presence in comparison to other states of India. The reason behind disproportionate presence was <b>that providing statehood to Delhi would make Delhi a unique state </b>which would not only govern Delhi but also govern important institutions of the country like the Union Parliament, Supreme Court, foreign embassies etc. However, the committee said that if it denies statehood to Delhi then it would be denying the people of Delhi a stake in their own future.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Thus, the committee suggested a <b>mid-way solution that Delhi </b>should be given a special status which makes it somewhere above the other <b>Union Territories and somewhere below to the States.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">69<span class="s3">th</span> Constitutional Amendment</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">To implement the suggestion of the </span>S.
