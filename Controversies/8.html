      Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code introduced in 1861 during the British
      rule of India. Modelled on the <b>Buggery Act of 1533, </b>it makes sexual
      activities &quot;<b>against the order of nature</b>&quot; illegal. On 6
      September 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the application of
      Section 377 to consensual homosexual sex between adults was
      unconstitutional, &quot;<b
        >irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary</b
      >&quot;, but that Section 377 remains in force relating to sex with
      minors, non-consensual sexual acts, and bestiality.

      criminalising sexual activities with consent in private not only impairs
      the dignity of those persons but is also discriminatory and impacts the

      equality before law and this applies to all classes of citizens. It has

      It is ironic that the main argument against homosexuality is that it is
      <b>against the religion, </b>when the Hindu mythology has in its various
      scriptures mentioned homosexuality or traits of homosexuality. The
      sculptures on the <b>sacred Hindu temple Khajuraho depict </b>various acts
      of carnal <b>sexual intercourse and homosexuality </b>and ancient Hindu
      scriptures such as <b>Kama Sutra</b>, talk about people of the
      <b>‘third nature’ </b>and their desires. While such desires were
      considered deviant in other parts of the world that now embrace
      homosexuality,

      A Delhi High Court judgment in 1984 ruled that
      <b>equality and freedom have no place in family. </b>Such oppression often
      forces the members of the family to suppress or hide their sexual
      preferences and as a result, they get married to people of opposite sex
      not just destroying their lives but also the lives of their spouses. Those
      people who come out and express their
      <b>sexual orientation are often shamed</b>, belittled and abused. They are
      kicked out of the houses and are considered an embarrassment. Due to the
      societal, ethical and religious pressures parents silence the voices and
      opinion of their children. Such attitude from one’s own family led to
      suicide of many people from LGBT community.
