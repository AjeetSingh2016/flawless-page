DE Mellow </b>and support of <b>Maharaja of Patiala in 1927</b>. During those times cricket was a well-administered sport in India and was funded mainly by the nawabs, maharajas, princes who were at the helm of administration of cricket and they set a noble <b>tradition of managing the game in India</b>. Initially it was functioning as an unregistered association and in 1940 it got registered under <b>the Societies Registration Act of 1860</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Internationally and nationally the wide popularity for the game have exemplified in the recent years because of the success of <b>Indian Premier League </b>introduced by <b>BCCI in 2008. </b>In the year 1926, BCCI joined the <b>Imperial Cricket Council</b>, the governing body for international cricket. In 1936 the started India&#39;s premier first-class cricket championship<b>, the Ranji Trophy</b>. It was named after the first Indian person who played international cricket, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawanagar_State" class="a" target="_blank">the King of </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K.S._Ranjitsinhji" class="a" target="_blank">Nawanagar state, K.S. </a><b>Ranjitsinhji</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Board of Control for Cricket in India’ and its rather imperious status of being “<b>the single national governing body for all cricket in India</b>,” the BCCI is, by its own reckoning, a mere <b>private, autonomous entity </b>with no public mandate or governmental control.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The case in point is the stand taken by the BCCI in the case of <i><b>Zee Telefilms Ltd. v. Union of India</b></i>, wherein the BCCI <b>opposed the writ petition filed against </b>it in a matter pertaining to grant of exclusive television rights for cricket matches on the preliminary ground that it (the BCCI) was <b>not ‘State’ within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But in same proceedings Union filed a counter-affidavit contending, inter alia, that the <b>BCCI</b></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">is ‘State’, in that the BCCI has always been subjected to the de facto control and recognition</h1><h1 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">of the Ministry of Youth Affairs <span class="p">and Sport as the National apex body for cricket in India, that the team selected by the BCCI represents the country as the official Indian team, that the permission of the Government of India is required (and indeed sought) by the </span>BCCI for visiting foreign teams and that the BCCI has a public function, being accountable to the Government and to the people of India at large.</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is fait accompli that in <i><b>Zee Telefilms</b></i>, the Supreme Court of India, by a 3:2 verdict ruled <b>that (BCCI is not ‘State’)</b>, being essentially an autonomous non statutory body with no declared monopoly over the game of cricket, <b>no public function to discharge</b>, <b>no significant financial assistance from the Government </b>and not being subject to what could be</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">described as ‘<b>deep and pervasive control’ </b>by the Government. Consequently, the writ</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">petition filed under Article 32 was dismissed as ‘not maintainable’ against the BCCI.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BCCI allocates functional, financial, assistance to cricket in India is the justification that it</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is not fall under ‘State’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The dissenting judgment of <b>Sinha, J. in </b><i><b>Zee Telefilms </b></i>seeks to answer this question from various perspectives, and it is apposite to dwell on these at the very outset. One test of a private body which could be ‘State’ is whether the said private body is <b>“allowed to discharge public duty or positive obligation of a public nature and furthermore is allowed to perform regulatory and controlling functions and activities which were otherwise the job of the Government.”</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">That being the case, the nature of the function performed by a private body simpliciter could elevate it to the status of <b>‘State’. </b>Regardless of the <b>financial, functional and/ or administrative control by the Government.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For instance, the decision of a Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka in holding the</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bangalore International Airport Limited <span class="p">to be </span>‘State’ <span class="p">proceeded essentially on account of</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">the activities carried out by it, namely airport activities, which bear the stamp of <b>‘public function’.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whether BCCI performs a Public Function</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">State of India allowed BCCI to represent India in Internationally <span class="p">There has never really</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">been any dispute with regard to the fact that the ‘<b>Indian’ team selected by the BCCI </b>is, ipso facto, the team representing the country and that the players so selected <b>duly represent India, wearing national colours at most times</b>. As such, the BCCI, maybe unwittingly but irrefutably, has assumed a monopoly status that includes its a<b>bsolute right to regulate and control the sport of cricket in India </b>and significantly the rights of the citizens as regards their participation therein with a view to ultimately representing the nation. These facts by themselves are sufficient to conclude that <b>there is a dimension of ‘public function’ in the activities of the BCCI.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Resemblance <b>to ‘State’ activity</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">the regulation of the right of the viewers to witness the match on television and other media such as the internet;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">the <b>right of the public to attend </b>and witness the match at the stadium by purchasing tickets for value including their r<b>ight to enter the stadium upon complying with security protocols </b>and their right to remain in the stadium subject to compliance with the <b>ICC Anti-Racism Code </b>and general laws of nuisance;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The <b>right of players </b>to partake in the match subject to self-imposed standards of fitness, competence and discipline, coupled with the ICC regulations in respect of</p></li></ol><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">‘<b>doping’ or using banned performance-enhancing substances </b>and general discipline as codified under the ICC Code of Conduct for Players</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Relevance of Public Functions Test in the era of Globalization</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It was <b>Mathew J</b>. in his concurring opinion in <i><b>Sukhdev Singh‘s case </b></i>who propounded <b>“Public Functions Test” </b>as a criterion to find out instrumentalities of state under the expression “other authorities‘ within Article 12 Justice Matthews opinion in <i><b>Sukhdev Singh vs Bhagatram, 1975</b></i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">He observed that the test to determine whether an entity would satisfy the requirements of Article 12 can be stated as thus –</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="(a)"><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">a finding of state </span>financial support together with an unusual <i>degree of control </i>over the management and policies <span class="p">of the body may lead to an inference that the body is a State entity;</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(b)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">another important indicator is discharging of <b>important </b><i><b>public function </b></i>with state support being an irrelevant consideration.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(c)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">a corporation is an <i><b>agency or instrumentality of the government </b></i>for carrying on a business for the benefit of the public.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Subsequently, in <b>Zee Telefilms Case </b>there had been a detailed discussion on the <b>public functions </b>performed by BCCI and it was observed by the <b>Minority Bench that a body discharging public functions </b>and exercising monopoly power <b>would be an authority under Article 12.</b></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">BCCI exercises functions like <b>controlling and regulating the game of cricket</b>.
