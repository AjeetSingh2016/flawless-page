      Funds acquired for the purpose of Political party funding should be
      transparent, legal and regulated. The money received by some un-ethical
      means or money spent in some unethical means will be detrimental for the
      economy and the citizens. The huge flow of money in elections creates a
      tendency amongst the people in power to hoard the money during their
      tenure to arrange funds for contesting next elections. The question which
      always bothers the citizens is the source of money spent extravagantly by
      political parties during elections. There was a new scheme, Electoral bond
      scheme, 2018 introduced in 2017 in the Lok Sabha by the then Finance
      Minister. These Electoral bonds aim at curbing the flow of black money
      during elections and maintaining anonymity of the voters at the same time.
