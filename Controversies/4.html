</style></head><body><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introduction</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The collegium system is headed by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and four senior-most</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">judges of the Supreme Court. India’s Constitution originally stipulated that the judges of the Supreme Court and high courts would be appointed by the President based on a process of “consultation” with senior judges. The present collegium system emerged later based on three key rulings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evolution of the Collegium System</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The collegium system has its origin in a sequence of judgments called the <b>“Judges Cases”. </b>This system came into existence through interpretations of relevant Constitutional provisions in the Judges Cases by the Supreme Court. In the following three cases the collegium system has come into being:-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Judges Case 1<span class="p">: In the case of </span>S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India, 1981<span class="p">, the Supreme Court by a majority decision observed that the notion of primacy of the Chief Justice of India was not established in the Constitution. It held that the suggestion for appointment to a High Court can emerge from any of the office – bearer of the Constitution, as mentioned under Article 217 and not inevitably from the Chief Justice of the High Court.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Constitution bench also held that the word <b>“consultation” </b>used in Articles 124 and 217 of the Constitution was not <b>“concurrence” </b>which means that in spite of the fact that the president will consult these officials, his decisions was not ought to be in concurrence with everyone. The judgment of this landmark case tilted the balance of power in favor of the executive in matters concerning the appointments of judges of the High Court. This situation existed for the following 12 years.</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Judges Case 2<span class="p">: In the case of </span>Supreme Court Advocates – on – Record vs. Union of India <span class="p">, </span>1993<span class="p">, a nine – judge Constitutional bench rescinded the decision of the case of S.P. Gupta and formed a specific procedure called the </span>“Collegium System” <span class="p">for the transfer and appointment of the judges in the </span>higher judiciary<span class="p">. Underlining that the higher courts must function </span>“in protecting the integrity and guarding the independence of the judiciary” <span class="p">the majority verdict granted the primacy to the Chief Justice of India in matters of transfers and appointments while also ruling that the word </span>“consultation” <span class="p">would not decline the prime role of the Chief Justice of India in judicial appointments.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In this landmark judgment the court also held that, the duty of the <b>Chief Justice of India is basic and fundamental in nature</b>, as this being a topic within the judicial family, the executive does not have an equal duty in this concerned matter. Here, in this case the term <b>“consultation” </b>would contract in a minimal form. If the executive has an equal role and be in divergence of many a suggestion, commencement of indiscipline would grow in the judiciary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Guiding in the collegium system, the court observed that the <b>guidance should be given by the Chief Justice of India </b>with <b>due recommendations of his two senior most judges</b>, and this kind of guidance should be given effect to by the executive of our country. It is further continued that in spite of the fact that it was neutral to the executive to ask the collegium to rethink the matter if it had an objection to the name recommended, if, on re-evaluation the collegium repeated the same recommendation again, then the executive was ought to make the appointment.</p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Judges Case 3<span class="p">: In the year 1998, a Presidential Reference 1999 was issued by </span>K.R. Narayanan <span class="p">to the Supreme Court over the interpretation of the word </span>“consultation” <span class="p">under </span>Article 143 of the Constitution of India<span class="p">, that is the advisory jurisdiction granted to the</span></h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Supreme Court. The debate was on whether “consultation” demands consultation with several judges in making the Chief Justice of India’s opinion, or if the sole opinion of Chief Justice of India could by itself establish a “consultation”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In acknowledgement to this, the Supreme Court laid down <b>9 guidelines for the working of the coram for the transfers and appointments </b>– this has become the current form of the collegium system, and has been persistent ever since then. This point of view laid down that the guidance should be given by the <b>Chief Justice of India and the other four senior most judges</b>, instead of the usual two judges. It was also declared that the judges of the Supreme Court who hailed from the high court, for which the recommended name came, should also be consulted. It was also observed that even if two judges gave an unfavorable decision, the Chief Justice of India should not send the proposed names to the government.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seperation of powers and Collegium System</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">After the Supreme Court struck down the <b>National Judicial Appointment Commission Act </b>and the <b>99th Constitutional (Amendment) Act, </b>the people have once again started bringing attention towards the appointment of judges to the higher judiciary. Neither the Executive Appointment model that existed till 1998, nor the collegium system as practiced till now have not been satisfactory enough to safeguard the independence of judiciary.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Nevertheless, the majority view of the Constitution Bench which decided on the issue was in <b>favor of keeping the collegium system with the necessary changes </b>and is now hearing views and suggestions from the Government, Bar and civil society on how to improve the process while retaining control of appointment of judges with the judiciary itself. Under the</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">scheme of the Constitution, the ultimate interpreter of law is the Court, and not the legislature or the executive. Judicial Independence is, consequently, central to democracy because it is judiciary that helps in the realization of the Rule of Law and safeguards the human rights. But the concept of independence is an intricate on which subsumes in its idea like <b>impartiality, accountability, efficiency and respect </b>for the Constitution and other institutions of governance.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Considering this, one has to differentiate between personal independence from institutional independence, as well as actual independence from recognized independence. Under <b>Article 50 of the Indian Constitution</b>, the independence of <b>judiciary is separated from the executive</b>. The process of removal of judges is difficult and their terms of service cannot be changed to the disadvantage of judges. At the same time the Executive branch of government decides the extent of the resources that are to be made obtainable to the judiciary for administration of justice.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Therefore, it is clear that independence of judiciary is a double concept which covers the independence or impartiality of the individual judge as well as the independence of the judicial branch from the Legislature and Executive branch. These are called as personal independence and institutional independence correspondingly. Indeed, a <b>judge’s personal independence is insufficient unless it is accompanied by the institutional independence </b>of the judicial branch. The concept of separation of powers is in relevance to the later part of independence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Merits of the Collegium System</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The major benefit given by this system to our country is to protect and safeguard the separation of powers between the three organs of our Government, which is the basic structure of the Constitution. It ensures that the independent nature of the judiciary is not affected by the Legislature or the Executive.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Justice Sathasivam <span class="p">is of the opinion that the </span>Collegium System has become a little more transparent and the consultation is made to be broad <span class="p">– based, as a result it will be best suited for the appointment of the judges.8 He also said that, “we as judges know the capability and character of the persons who are considered for appointment as judges to the Supreme Court and high courts”. This statement by him makes it clear that it would </span>become difficult for people who are not associated with the daily work of courts to shortlist the best people for the required position<span class="p">. On comparing to the Judicial Appointment Commission (JAC), the current Collegium System scrutinizes the shortlisted candidates more accurately for the qualities expected of a judge in the Supreme Court or the High Court.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Flaws in the collegium System</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The current process adopted by the collegium of judges is beset with its own set of issues of <b>non-transparency and non-accountability </b>apart from excluding Executive completely in the collaborative and consultative exercise for employment of judges to Bench of higher judiciary. The working of the collegium has marked the total breakdown of the inter-institutional system provided <b>in Article 124 and Article 217 </b>of the Constitution of India. This system incorporates de facto judicial supremacy over appointments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In spite of the fact that the executive must formally affirm the appointment, the role is limited as its objections <b>can be overridden by the collegium</b>, whose conclusion is determinative in practice. The marginal role of the executive deprives the possibility of an inter-institutional check and balance on the judiciary and also paves way for the public questioning of the executive in relevance to judicial appointments pointless as the executive inevitably pleads helplessness. The collegium system has been criticised on several grounds. Lastly, one other major disadvantage of the collegium system that has</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">been observed over the years recently is that almost <b>thirty per cent seats in different High Courts of the country remain empty </b>due to inefficient working of the collegium.</p></body></html>
