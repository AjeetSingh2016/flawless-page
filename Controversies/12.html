Rule 26 of the Rules framed under the <b>Defences of India Act 1939 </b>allowed the detention of a person if it was “satisfied with respect to that particular person that such detention was necessary to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence and safety of the Country.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Post-Independence</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The first <b>Preventive Detention Act was passed in 1950</b>. (Preventive Detention Act 1950) The validity of this act was challenged in the Supreme Court in the <b>A.K Gopalan Vs. State of Madras Court</b>. The Supreme Court held this act constitutionally valid except some provisions. This act expired in 1969, and before it expired, it was amended for 7 times, each expansion was to make it valid for 3 more years and this it was extended till 31 December 1969.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In 1971, the <b>Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) </b>was passed by the parliament; the act was basically a modified version of the PDA Act (1950). The Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) giving the <b>administration of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi </b>and Indian law enforcement agencies super powers - indefinite preventive detention of individuals, search and seizure of property without warrants, and wiretapping - in the quelling of civil and political disorder in India, as well as countering foreign-inspired sabotage, terrorism, subterfuge and threats to national security. During the period of <b>national emergency (1975-1977) as thousands of innocent people </b>were believed to have been arbitrarily arrested, tortured and in some cases, forcibly sterilized. <b>some 1,00,000 people, which included </b>journalists, scholars, activists and opposition politicians were detained without trial for a period of up to eighteen months.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Some people were even detained for opposing forced sterilization drives or demolition of slums carried out during this period. The law was repealed in 1977 following the election of a Janata Party-led government; the <b>44th Amendment Act of 1978 </b>similarly <b>removed MISA from the 9th Schedule.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In the heat of the terrorism in Punjab the <b>Terrorist &amp; Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act </b>or infamous TADA was enacted in 1985. It was renewed in 1989, 1991 and 1993 and lapsed in 1995 due to increasing unpopularity due to widespread allegations of abuse. The main <b>abuse was that a confession before a police officer</b>, even though being given under torture, was <b>admissible as evidence in Court</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">According to this Act the arrested person has to be produced before the Magistrate within 24 hours but he has to be <b>detained up to 180 days without filling any charge sheet</b>, which is similar to the later act POTA Act (2002). After the Bombay attacks of November 26, 2008 parliament enacted another anti-terror law known as unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">National security Act 1980</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Allows for <b>detention without charge or trial for up to 12 months to prevent a person </b>&quot;from acting in any <b>manner prejudicial to the defence of India, </b>the relations of India with foreign powers, or the security of India&quot; or &quot;from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State or from acting in any manner prejudicial to <b>the maintenance of public order </b>or from acting in any manner <b>prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community&quot;</b></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Act, 1974 <span class="p">Allows for detention without </span>charge or trial for up to two years to prevent a person <span class="p">from –</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">i) smuggling goods, or (ii) abetting the smuggling of goods, or (iii) engaging in transporting or concealing or keeping smuggled goods, or (iv) dealing in, smuggled goods otherwise than by engaging in transporting or concealing or keeping smuggled goods, or (v) harbouring persons engaged in smuggling goods or in abetting the smuggling of goods.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988 <span class="p">The Act allows for detention without charge or trial for up to two years to prevent a person “from </span>engaging in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances<span class="p">”.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Prevention of Black marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980 <span class="p">it allows for detention </span>without charge of trial for up to six months <span class="p">to prevent a person &quot;from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplied of commodities essential to the community&quot;</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Preventive Detention and Constitution of India</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In case of arrest and detention various safeguards are provided to the arrested person under Article 22(1) and (2) but these safeguards are not provided to the arrested detenu under the preventive detention law under Articles 22(3). The safeguards in connection with this preventive detention are provided under clauses (4) to (7).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per Article 22(2), safeguards under 22(1) and (2) is not available to person who are detained under Preventive detention. As per Article 22(4), The Preventive detention cannot <b>extend beyond a period of 3 months</b>. Every case of preventive detention must be placed before an Advisory Board composed of Judges of the High Court (or persons</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">qualified for Judges of the High Court) the case must be presented <b>before the Advisory Board within 3 months, a continued detention after 3 months</b>, if Advisory Board deems it necessary. The person will be given an opportunity to afford earliest opportunity to make a representation against the preventive detention.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">But Article 22(7), is an exception to Article 22(4), when the parliament prescribes by law the <b>circumstances under which a person may be kept in detention beyond 3 months without the opinion of the advisory board.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Role of the judiciary and Power of the Executive</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The judiciary has the vital and primary role to play in such detention cases. The reason is that, in case of a criminal proceeding, a person’s liberty is curtailed under the law as an act of punitive detention, where the application of a judicial mind is ensured prior to the detention, but in preventive detention cases, the executives are empowered with draconian powers with respect to detention orders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Their subjective satisfaction is predominant over the detenu’s interest and the review of its action is given to the Advisory Boards, which is also an executive authority. In such circumstances, there is every possibility of abuse and misuse of power by the detaining authorities, which deprives the detenu of his fundamental right of personal liberty.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Ankur Chandra Pradhan vs union of India 1997</b>, The object of preventive detention is not to punish but to intercept the detenu from doing something prejudicial to the state. Realistic result of the adoption of preventive detention as a permanent feature of our constitution is that even in peace time, the court cannot question for the adequacy of reasons for depriving a detenu of his liberty. (See Gopalan vs State of madras 1950).</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rights provided to the detained person</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">No detention beyond 3 months. Sub clause (a) of clause (4) of the Article 22 provides that a law providing preventive detention shall not authorize the detention of a person for a longer period than three months. First part of Article 22(5) gives a right to the detained person to be furnished with the ground on which the order has been made.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per section 3(3) of the COFEPOSA Act 1974 provides that the <b>ground of detention should be communicated to the detenu within 5 days and in exceptional cases 15 days</b>. Section 8 of the National Security Act, 1980 requires the detaining officer to communicate to the <b>detenu the grounds on which the order of detention has been made promptly.</b></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Note <span class="p">- Second part of Article 22(5) provides that </span>earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order of detention <span class="p">should be given to the detenu.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nature of Preventive detention as per Indian Judiciary</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The nature of preventive detention has been explained by the Supreme Court in the case of</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Khudiram Das v.
