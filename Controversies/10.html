      Despite of NHRC guidelines on police encounter and Supreme Court’s warning
      police encounters are still occurring and violating the human rights of
      the convicted person. Police encounters are the direct encroachment over

      On 10th July 24, 2020 a news was flashed early in the morning that the
      most wanted criminal who has killed eight policemen in UP and now
      absconding is being encountered by the police while he was being brought
      to Kanpur from Madhya Pradesh as he was arrested at the Mahakaal Ujjain
      temple after finding him suspicious by the police officers, but on the way
      he was encountered by the police officials. It was being told by the
      police officers that he was attempting to snatch the gun or weapon and
      flee from the scene when one of the cars in the police convoy overturned,
      so only option rests with the police was to encounter him on the spot
      (reported Times of India).

      In our country there is no any specific act or legislation which deals
      with the police encounter, but there are many other provisions that define
      the protection in regard with this act. The Indian Penal Code defines
      sections which provide the protection in case of private defense.
      <b>Section 97 defines Right of private defense</b>, as contained in
      chapter XVI of the Indian Penal Code this protection provides in case
      where an action of assaulting criminals or offenders whose may reasonably
      cause the apprehension of death or grievous hurt to himself or to any
      other person, this section enables the use of force in self defense. So
