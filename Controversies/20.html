Similarly, India has enacted multiple laws and the prevailing one is the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The UAPA was originally developed as an Act to prevent the unlawful activities in India. Although, the UAPA has been in force since 1967, the Parliament amended the UAPA in the <b>year 2004 thereby adding the dedicated chapters to deal with terrorist activities </b>in the interest of securing and protecting the sovereignty and integrity of India. Thereafter, three amendments were made in the UAPA viz. <b>2008, 2012 and most recently in the year 2019.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Interrelation between 16<span class="s3">th</span> Constitutional amendment Act and UAPA Act, 1967:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The Constitution of India underwent its <b>first amendment in the year 1951 , </b>and substituted few provisions under clause (2) in Article 19, which provided reasonable restrictions upon exercising such rights. Article 19(2) was further amended in the year 1963 vide the <b>Constitution  (Sixteenth  Amendment)  Act,  1963  </b>upon  the  recommendation  of  the Committee on ‘<b>National Integration and Regionalism’ </b>which was appointed by <b>National Integration Council </b>to impose reasonable restrictions in the <b>interest of sovereignty and integrity of India. </b>Further, in order to implement the provisions of the said amendment of the Constitution, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Bill was introduced in the Parliament and was passed by both the Houses of Parliament and received its assent from the President of India on December 30, 1967, which ultimately became the law as the <b>Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The very Idea of 2004 amendment:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The principal Act of UAPA had the provisions to deal with the unlawful activities only and there had been <b>no provisions to deal with terrorist activities</b>.

Since then, the <b>UAPA became the foremost legislation to combat terrorism in India.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Key Amendments to the Act:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2004 Amendment:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">This amendment substituted a new chapter for Chapter IV which is, “<b>Punishment for Terrorist Activities.”  </b>The amendment also incorporated terms such as “terrorist act”, “terrorist gang” and “terrorist organisation.”  The term “terrorist act” had been defined under Section 15.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Section 16 prescribes the “<b>punishment for the terrorist Act</b>”, Section 17 was also substituted which is related to “<b>Punishment for raising fund for terrorist act</b>”.

Thus, the amendment specifically widens the scope of the UAPA to combat terrorism and empowers the Central Government to categorize an individual as a terrorist.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The heading of <b>Chapter VI </b>substituted the name of <b>“individuals” </b>along with the terrorist organisations and thus it will now be titled as <b>“Terrorist Organisations and Individuals.” Section 35(1)(a) </b>of Chapter VI, empowers the Central Government to categorize an organization in the First Schedule or <b>“an individual” as terrorist in the Fourth Schedule</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Section 35(1)(c) <span class="p">empowers the Central Government </span>to remove the name of an organization</h1><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">in the First Schedule or “an individual” from the Fourth Schedule<span class="p">.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">According to the provisions of <b>Section 36, </b>apart from the Terrorist organization<b>, the “individuals” </b>can also move an application to the Central Government to <b>remove his name from the Fourth Schedule. </b>Under section 25(1) Power of Director General of National Investigation Agency enlarged to make an order to seize the property.

The said amendment has been criticised on the ground that, it is unfettered, discretionary and unbound powers are vested upon the government <b>which is prone to misuse and hence violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India</b>, further it has been criticized that <b>it also violates Article 19(1)(a) </b>, the freedom of speech and expression. There has also been a criticism that the said amendment deprives the right to life and personal liberty of an <b>individual guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which includes the right to reputation as well</b>.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">As per Article 14, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.” In <b>E. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu</b>, the Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that, “equality is dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and cannot be cribbed, cabined and confined within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">With the advent of time the equality has developed a new concept i.e., concept of arbitrariness, which is antithesis to the right to equality under Article 14. Therefore, if any <b>action of state is arbitrary being unreasonable </b>then it is the enemy of Article 14 and cannot be said to be constitutional. In <b>Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India</b>, the Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that, “<b>Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality  of  treatment.  </b>The  principle  of  reasonableness  which  legally  as  well  as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Article 21 must answer the test of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article 14.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">But In the famous case of <b>State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar</b>, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India laid down the following tests of reasonable classification: Classification must be based on intelligible differentia. This means that persons being differentiated for any reason must be intelligible. I<b>ntelligible differentia must have rationale nexus from the object sought to be achieved</b>. Reasonable Classification Can be considered as <b>one of the exception to Right to Equality.</b></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What makes UAPA prone to Misuse</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l1"><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The pre-charge sheet custody (<b>time given to the police to investigate the case</b>) of the accused is extended from the usual 60 or 90 days under general criminal law to a period of 180 days of incarceration.</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The UAPA also restricts the <b>right of the accused to be released on bail </b>if the court comes to a conclusion, based on police documents, that it appears that he has committed an offence.

But despite these overarching powers, the conviction rate under the law is abysmally low. Hence, the activists argue that the law should have no place in a legal system governed by a democracy and must be repealed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Section 43D (5) took away the discretion provided to the Court or Judge <span class="p">under Chapter XXXIII of the CrPC with regard to bail. Section 43E reversed </span>the burden of the Prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused provided under the CrPC <span class="p">to the accused arrested under the UAPA to prove his/her innocence with respect to certain offences.
