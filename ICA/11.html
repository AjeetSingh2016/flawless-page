The expression &quot;estate&quot; has been defined differently in different States and, as a result of the transfer of land from one State to another on account of the reorganisation of States, the expression has come to be defined differently in different parts of the same State.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Moreover, <b>many of the land reform enactments relate to lands which are not included in an estate. </b>Several State Acts relating to land reform were struck down on the ground that the provisions of those Acts were violative of articles 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution and that the <b>protection of article 31A was not available to them</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is, therefore, <b>proposed to amend the definition of &quot;estate&quot; </b>in article 31A of the Constitution by <b>including therein, lands held under ryotwari settlement and also other lands in respect of which provisions </b>are normally made in land reform enactments. It is further proposed to provide that <b>where any law makes a provision for the acquisition </b>by the State of any estate and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under his personal cultivation, it shall not be lawful for the State to acquire any such land as is within the ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto, unless the law relating to the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">acquisition of such land, building or structure provides for payment of compensation at a rate not less than the market value thereof.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">2. It is also proposed <b>to amend the Ninth Schedule by including therein certain State enactments relating to land reform </b>in order to <b>remove any uncertainty or doubt </b>that may arise in regard to their validity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Provisions under Amendment:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/660119/" class="a" target="_blank">Amended </a>Article 31A and provides that the acquisition of any land under personal cultivation by the state shall <b>be held unlawful without payment of compensation equal to the market value.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.mea.gov.in/Images/pdf1/S9.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">Amended the </a>Ninth Schedule and added 44 state acts <span class="p">relating to land matters.</span></h1></body></html>
