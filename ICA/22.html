So far as the <b>Prime Minister and the Speaker are concerned</b>, matters relating to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">their election are <b>regulated by the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. </b>Under this Act the High Court has jurisdiction to try an election petition presented against either of them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The President, the Vice-President, the Prime Minister and the Speaker are holders of high offices. <b>The President is not answerable to a court of law for anything done, while in office, in the exercise of his powers. </b>A fortiori matters relating to his election should not be brought before a court of law but should be entrusted to a forum other than a court. The same reasoning applies equally to the incumbents of the offices of Vice-President, Prime Minister and Speaker. It is accordingly <b>proposed to provide that disputes relating to the election of the President and Vice-President shall be determined by a forum as may be determined by a parliamentary law.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Similar provision is proposed to be made in the case of the election to either House of Parliament or, as the case may be, to the House of the People of a person holding the office of Prime Minister or the Speaker. It is further proposed <b>to render pending proceedings in respect of such election under the existing law null and void. </b>The Bill also provides that the <b>parliamentary law creating a new forum for trial of election matters relating to the incumbents of the high offices abovementioned shall not be called in question in any court.</b></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Recourse was had in the past to the Ninth Schedule whenever it was found that progressive legislation conceived in the interests of the public was imperilled by litigation. It has become necessary to have recourse to this device once again now. Between 1971 and 1973 legislation was enacted for nationalising coking coal and coal mines for conservating these resources in the interests of steel industry. These <b>enactments have been brought before courts on the ground that they are unconstitutional.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">So is the case of sick textile undertakings which <b>were nationalised in 1974</b>.
