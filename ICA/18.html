The provisions of <b>clause (1) of article 371 </b>of the Constitution <b>were intended to give effect to certain features of these safeguards</b>. The Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957, was enacted inter alia <b>to provide for employment opportunities for residents of Telangana area</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">But in 1969, the Supreme Court held the relevant provision of the Act to be <b>unconstitutional is so far as it related to the safeguards </b>envisaged for the Telangana area. Owing to a variety of causes, the working of the safeguards gave rise to a certain amount of dissatisfaction sometimes in the Telangana area and sometimes in the other areas of the State.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Measures <b>were devised from time to time to resolve the problems</b>. Recently several leaders of Andhra Pradesh made a concerted effort to analyse the factors which have been giving rise to the dissatisfaction and find enduring answers to the problems with a view to <b>achieving fuller emotional integration of the people of Andhra Pradesh.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the 21st September, 1973, they suggested certain measures (generally known as the</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Six-Point Formula<span class="p">) indicating </span>a uniform approach for promoting accelerated development of the backward areas of the State <span class="p">so as to secure the balanced development of the State</span></h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">as a whole and for providing <b>equitable opportunities to different areas </b>of the State in this matter of education, employment and career prospects in public services. This formula has received wide support in Andhra Pradesh and has been endorsed by the State Government.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This Bill has been brought forward to provide the necessary constitutional authority for giving effect to the <b>Six-Point Formula in so far as it relates to the provision of equitable opportunities for people of different areas </b>of the State in the matter of admission to educational institutions and public employment and constitution of an Administrative Tribunal with jurisdiction to deal with certain disputes and grievances relating to public services.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Bill also seeks to empower <b>Parliament to legislate for establishing a Central University in the State and contains provisions </b>of an incidental and consequential nature including the provision for the validation of certain appointments made in the past. As the Six-Point Formula provides for the discontinuance of the Regional Committee constituted under clause (1) of article 371 of the Constitution, <b>the Bill also provides for the repeal of that clause.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Provisions under Amendment</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l2"><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://legislative.gov.in/constitution-thirty-second-amendment-act-1973" class="a" target="_blank">The </a>amendment provided <b>special provisions in respect of admission to educational institutions and public employment</b>, especially in civil services and the constitution of an Administrative Tribunal with jurisdiction to deal with disputes and grievances regarding public services.</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Provided a provision <b>to establish a Central university in Andhra Pradesh</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Amended the <b>Seventh Schedule </b>of the Constitution.</p></li></ul></li></ol></body></html>
