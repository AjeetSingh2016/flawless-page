The Supreme Court in its judgment dated 16th November, 1992 in the case of <b>Indra Sawhney and Others vs. Union of India and Others</b>, however, observed that <b>reservation of appointments or posts under article 16(4) </b>of the Constitution is <b>confined to initial appointment and cannot extent to reservation in the matter of promotion. </b>This ruling of the Supreme Court will adversely affect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Since the representation of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in services in the <b>States have not reached the required level</b>, it is necessary to continue the existing dispensation of <b>providing reservation in promotion in the case of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes</b>. In view of the commitment of the Government to protect the interest of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, the Government have decided to continue the existing policy of reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">To carry out this, <b>it is necessary to amend article 16 of the Constitution by inserting a new clause (4A) </b>in the said article to provide for reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Provisions under Amendment</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l1"><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This amendment has added a <b>new clause (4-a) to Article 16 </b>of the Constitution which <b>empowers the State to make any reservation provisions in favour of SCs and STs in promotions in government jobs </b>where it is of the opinion that they are inadequately represented in state services.
