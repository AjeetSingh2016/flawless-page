It refers to any tax on the supply of goods, services, or both, except taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages for human consumption.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The introduction of the <b>Goods and Services Tax (GST) </b>is a big step forward in India’s indirect tax reforms. By merging a <b>significant number of Central and State taxes into a single tax, </b>GST will significantly <b>reduce the negative consequences of double taxation and lay the groundwork for a common national market</b>. The main advantage for consumers would be a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is expected to be between <b>25% and 30%. </b>This would also mean that the consumer would be far more aware of the true cost of indirect taxes on goods and services. Due to the <b>full neutralization of input taxes across the value chain of production and distribution</b>, the introduction of GST would <b>make Indian products competitive in both domestic and international markets</b>. Last but again not least, this tax would be easier to administer due to its transparency and self-policing nature. <b>It would also promote a transition from an informal to a formal economy.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 246 of the Indian Constitution <b>divides legislative powers</b>, including revenue, between the Parliament of India and the State Legislatures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Constitution divides fiscal authorities between the Centre and the States, with essentially no overlap between the two spheres. The Centre has the authority to tax the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">manufacture of commodities (except for <b>alcoholic beverages for human use, opium, drugs, </b>and similar substances), <b>while the States have the power to tax the sale of goods</b>. In the context of inter-state sales, the Centre has the authority to impose a tax (the Central Sales Revenue), but the tax is wholly collected and held by the originating states.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In terms of services, only the Centre has <b>the authority to charge service tax</b>. Because the states <b>lack the authority to levy taxes on the sale or purchase of products </b>during their importation or exportation from India, the Centre imposes and collects this tax in supplementary to the Basic Customs Duty. This customs duty (also known <b>as CVD and SAD</b>) offsets excise duty, sales tax, state VAT, and other taxes levied on similar domestic products. <b>The introduction of GST demanded constitutional adjustments to allow the Centre and the States to tax and collect GST at the same time.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Provision under Amendment</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l1"><li data-list-text=""><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Goods and Services Tax (GST) <span class="p">commenced on 8 September 2016 with the enactment and subsequent notices of the 101st Constitution Amendment Act, 2016.</span></h1></li><li data-list-text=""><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/77052/" class="s2" target="_blank">The constitution incorporated </a><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/77052/" class="a" target="_blank">Articles </a><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1135479/" class="a" target="_blank">246A, </a><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1532903/" class="a" target="_blank">269A, and </a>279A<span class="p">.
