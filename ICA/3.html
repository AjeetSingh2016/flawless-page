      In order to <b>implement the scheme of States reorganisation, </b>it is
      necessary to make numerous amendments in the Constitution with effect from

      Clause 2.-The reorganisation scheme involves not only the establishment of
      new States and alterations in the area and boundaries of the existing

      Part B and Part C States) and the classification of certain areas as Union

        constituencies&quot; will no longer be appropriate</b

      be divided into a number of constituencies and will not permit of being
      grouped together with other States for this purpose or being
      &quot;formed&quot; into a single territorial constituency. Clause (2) of

      Clause 22.-The High Court of Travancore-Cochin will, as from the appointed
      day, become the High Court for the new State of Kerala and the High Courts
      of Mysore and Rajasthan will continue, respectively, as the High Courts
      for the enlarged &quot;new&quot; States with the same names. Taking into

      Clause 23.-The existence of three entries in the legislative lists
      <b>(33 of List I, 36 of List II and 42 of List III) </b>relating to the
      essentially single subject of acquisition and requisitioning of property
