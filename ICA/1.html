</style></head><body><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Statements of Object and Reason</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">During the last fifteen months of the working of the Constitution, certain difficulties have been brought to light by judicial decisions and pronouncements specially in regard to the chapter on fundamental rights. The citizen&#39;s right to <b>freedom of speech </b>and expression guaranteed by <b>article 19(1)(a) </b>has been held by some courts to be so comprehensive as not to render a person culpable even if he advocates murder and other crimes of violence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In other countries with written constitutions, <b>freedom of speech and of the press is not regarded as debarring the State from punishing or preventing abuse of this freedom</b>. The citizen&#39;s right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business conferred by article 19(1)(g) <b>is subject to reasonable restrictions </b>which the laws of the State may impose &quot;<b>in the interests of general public</b>&quot;. While the words cited are comprehensive enough to cover any scheme of nationalisation which the State may undertake, it is desirable to place the matter beyond doubt by a <b>clarificatory addition to article 19(6).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Another article in regard to which unanticipated difficulties have arisen is article 31. The validity of agrarian reform measures passed by the State Legislatures in the last three years has, in spite of the provisions of clauses (4) and (6) of article 31, formed the subject-matter of dilatory litigation, as a result of which the implementation of these important measures, affecting large numbers of people, has been held up.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The main objects of this Bill are, <b>accordingly to amend article 19 for the purposes indicated above and to insert provisions fully securing the constitutional validity of zamindari abolition laws </b>in general and certain specified State Acts in particular. the opportunity has been taken to propose a few minor amendments to other articles in order to remove difficulties that may arise.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is laid down in <b>Article 46 as a directive principle of State policy that the State should promote with special care the educational and economic interests </b>of the weaker sections of the people and protect them from social injustice. In order that any special provision that the State may make for the educational, economic or social advancement of any backward class of citizens <b>may not be challenged on the ground of being discriminatory</b>, it is proposed that Article 15(3) should be suitably amplified. Certain amendments in respect of articles dealing with the convening and proroguing of the sessions of Parliament have been found necessary and are also incorporated in this Bill. So also a few minor amendments in respect of Articles 341, 342, 372 and 376.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Provisions under Amendments</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Empowered the state to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and economically backward classes.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Provided for the saving of laws providing for acquisition of estates, etc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Added <b>Ninth Schedule to protect the land reforms and other laws </b>included in it from the judicial review. After Article 31, Articles 31A and 31B were inserted.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Added three more grounds of restrictions on <b>freedom of speech and expression: public order, friendly relations with foreign states and incitement to an offence. </b>Also, it made the restrictions <b>‘reasonable’ </b>and thus, ‘<b>justiciable in nature’.</b></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Provided that state trading and nationalisation of any trade or business by the state is not to be invalid on the ground of violation of the right to trade or business.</p></body></html>
