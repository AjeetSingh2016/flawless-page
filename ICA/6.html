The requirement <b>that members of the two Houses should assemble at a joint sitting for the election </b>of the Vice-President seems to be totally unnecessary and may also cause practical difficulties. It is, therefore, proposed <b>to amend this article to provide that the Vice-President will be elected by members of an electoral college consisting of members </b>of both Houses of Parliament.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Under <b>Article 54 </b>of the Constitution, the President is <b>elected by an electoral college </b>consisting of the elected members of both Houses of Parliament and of the Legislative Assemblies of the States.

It is, however, possible that the elections to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">the two Houses of Parliament may not be completed before the President or the Vice-President is elected.
