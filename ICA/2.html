Despite the difference in the wording of the two clauses, they are regarded as dealing with the same subject.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The deprivation of property referred to in clause (1) is to be construed in the widest sense as including <b>any curtailment of a right to property</b>. Even where it is caused by a purely regulatory provision of law and is not accompanied by an <b>acquisition or taking possession </b>of that or any other property right by the State, the law, in order to be valid according to these decisions, <b>has to provide for compensation under clause (2) of the article</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is considered necessary, therefore, <b>to re-state more precisely the State&#39;s power of compulsory acquisition </b>and requisitioning of private property and distinguish <b>it from cases where the operation of regulatory </b>or prohibitory laws of the State results in <b>&quot;deprivation of property&quot;</b>. This is sought to be done in clause 2 of the Bill.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It will be recalled that the zamindari abolition laws which came first in our programme of social welfare legislation were attacked by <b>the interests affected mainly with reference to articles 14, 19 and 31</b>, and that in order to put an end to the dilatory and wasteful litigation and place these laws above challenge in the courts, <b>Articles 31A and 31B and the Ninth Schedule were enacted by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act</b>.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Subsequent judicial decisions interpreting articles 14, 19 and 31 have raised serious difficulties in the way of the Union and the States putting through other and equally important social welfare legislation on the desired lines, e.g., the following -</p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="(i)"><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">While the <b>abolition of zamindaris and the numerous intermediaries between the State and the tiller of the soil has been achieved for the most part</b>, our next objectives in land reform are the fixing of limits to the extent of agricultural land that may be owned or occupied by any person, the disposal of any land held in excess of the prescribed maximum and the further modification of the rights of land owners and tenants in agricultural holdings.</p></li><li data-list-text="(ii)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The proper planning of urban and rural areas requires the beneficial utilisation of vacant and waste lands and the clearance of slum areas.</p></li><li data-list-text="(iii)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In the <b>interest of national economy </b>the State should have full control over the mineral and oil resources of the country, including in particular, the power to cancel or modify the terms and conditions of prospecting licenses, mining leases and similar agreements. This is also necessary in relation to <b>public utility undertakings which supply power</b>, light or water to the public under licenses granted by the State.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(iv)"><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is often necessary to take over under State management for a temporary period a commercial or industrial undertaking or other property <b>in the public interest </b>or in order to secure the <b>better management of the undertaking or property</b>.

It is considered that any such question ought to be left to the final decision of the Legislature.
