If the impediments to the growth of the Constitution are not removed, the <b>Constitution will suffer a virtual atrophy</b>. The question of amending the Constitution for removing the difficulties which have arisen in achieving the <b>objective of socio-economic revolution</b>, which would end poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity, has been engaging the active attention of Government and the public for some years now.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The democratic institutions provided in the <b>Constitution are basically sound and the path for progress does not lie in denigrating any of these institutions. </b>However, there could be no denial that these institutions have been subjected to considerable stresses and strains and that vested interests have been trying to <b>promote their selfish ends to the great detriment of public good.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Constitution to spell out expressly the high ideals <b>of socialism, secularism and the integrity of the nation</b>, to make the directive principles more comprehensive and give them precedence over those fundamental rights which have been allowed to be relied upon to frustrate socio-economic reforms for implementing the directive principles. It is also proposed to specify the <b>fundamental duties of the citizens and make special provisions for dealing with anti-national activities</b>, whether by individuals or associations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Parliament and the State Legislatures embody the will of the people and the essence of democracy is that the will of the people should prevail.
