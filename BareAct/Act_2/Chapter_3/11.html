      <h4>Section 28</h4>
      <h4> Effect of transfer of property on right to maintenance</h4>
    <p>Where a dependant has a right to receive maintenance out of an estate and such estate or any part thereof is transferred, the right to receive maintenance may be enforced against the transferee if the transferee has notice of the right, or if the transfer is gratuitous; but not against the transferee for consideration and without notice of the right.</p>
