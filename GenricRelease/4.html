In accordance with current government election promises, they intend to cut taxes if they are re- elected, and ensure that people will pay less taxes.  Due  to  Sri  Lanka&#39;s  current  president&#39;s  policy  of  large  tax  cuts, government revenue and fiscal policies have suffered, resulting in soaring budget deficits Among these measures were the increased tax-free  thresholds,  which  decreased  the number of taxpayers by 33.5%, reducing VAT to 8%, reducing corporate tax from 28% to 24%, eliminating the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax and imposing the 2% &quot;nation- building tax&quot; that  financed  infrastructure  development. Because of the substantial reduction in tax revenue, rating agencies have downgraded the sovereign credit rating, making it harder to take on more debt. The rating agencies expressed concern.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Consequently, Sri Lanka&#39;s state coffers will soon be empty, and the country may soon run out of funds. Due to this, investors fled SriLanka and it became difficult for the country to access international markets. For the purpose of covering government expenditures, the Central Bank began printing money at a record pace, disregarding the advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cease printing money and instead raise interest rates and taxes while reducing expenditures . The IMF cautioned that continuing to print money will result in the collapse of the economy . CBSL allegedly printed 119.08 billion rupees on April, 2022, the highest amount reported on a single day for the entire year 2022. In 2022, the total amount of money added to the financial markets raised to Rs. 432.76 billion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">External debt to Srilanka</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Sri Lanka&#39;s external debt has doubled from 2010 and 2020. Foreign debt was approximately <b>42 percentage of its GDP in 2019</b>. SriLanka expects to repay its debtors US dollars 4 billion towards the end of 2022, while government reserves amounted to US dollars 2.3 billion as of April 2022. Even though commentaries blame China for a debt</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">crisis, the (ALI)- Australian Lowy Institute noted that Sri Lanka was not mired in a Chinese debt trap, due to the fact that external debt due to China was only around 10 percentage of total debt in April 2021.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The President&#39;s office announced in January 2022 that it would request to China to postpone its debt burden during talks with its foreign minister. As of March 2022, China has not responded officially. In 2020, Global credit Ratings agency indicated that SriLanka&#39;s existing financing sources were insufficient to cover the country&#39;s debt service requirements, valued at little over US dollar 4.0 billion in 2021.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">For SriLanka to solve its budgetary problems in repaying its debt, Treasury auctions must succeed, according to Bellwether. As soon as this is accomplished, the foreign exchange problem will be automatically resolved. Consequence of failed auctions of Treasury bills filled with printed currency, the government is sinking further into debt.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Srilankan policy in Agriculture Sector</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In April 2021 the current government made another blunder. It has been announced that Sri Lanka will only permit organic farming, banning all inorganic fertilizers and agrochemical fertilizers. The government believes that this will be beneficial to health. Sri anka was saving foreign reserves by banning the import of fertilizers. <b>Scientific and farming community They warned of a collapse in the farming sector because of the devaluation of the national currency</b>, which negatively affected the tea industry. However, this impacted agriculture production Tea farmers described the situation in the industry as critical, claiming that organic farming is ten times more costly and yields half as much as conventional farming. and protests against the plan, the government abandoned its plan to become the world&#39;s first organic-farming nation in 2021.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Srilankan Tourism Sector</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The tourism industry in Sri Lanka was negatively affected by the Easter bombings of 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic that followed In the event that borders were closed, tourists completely ceased to arrive, resulting in a decrease in tourism-related revenues. <b>Sri Lanka&#39;s tourism industry contributes 13 per cent of the country&#39;s GDP</b>. SriLanka managed to welcome just 173,000 tourists 2018. The number was 2.3 million. You see the gap by 2021, Sri Lanka&#39;s tourism revenue was down to USD 2.8 billion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Russian Ukrainian war effected tea Exports and tourism sector</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Because of the ongoing tense situation between Russia and Ukraine due to the Russian-Ukrainian War, Sri Lanka&#39;s economic conditions are already sluggish Russia is the second biggest market for Sri Lanka&#39;s tea exports. Additionally, S<b>ri Lanka&#39;s tourism industry is heavily dependent on these two nations</b>, as the majority of visitors arrive from either Russia or Ukraine. As a result, the Ukrainian crisis has put a halt to economic recovery in Sri Lanka, which has been adversely affected by <b>both the tea and tourism sectors</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Srilanka and Inflation rate</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The annual inflation rate in Sri Lanka eased slightly to <b>66 percent year-on-year in October of 2022</b>, from a record <b>69.8 percent in the previous month</b>, amid an economic and political crisis and a plunging currency. Prices rose at a slower pace for both <b>food </b>(85.6 percent vs a record 94.9 percent) and <b>non-food items </b>(56.3 percent vs 57.6 percent). Among non-food, main upward contribution came from cost of transport, housing &amp; utilities, restaurant &amp; hotels. On a monthly basis, <b>consumer prices fell 0.4 percent</b>, the first contraction since April 2021, following a 3.8 percent rise in September.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Role of India</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><u><b>India’s Assistance</b></u>: It would be completely unwise for India to let the Chinese take over expanding chunks of Sri Lankan territory. <b>India must offer Sri Lanka financial help, policy advice and investment from Indian entrepreneurs</b>. Indian businesses must build supply chains that <b>intertwine the Indian and Sri Lankan economies </b>in goods and services ranging from the export of tea to information technology services.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">India, rather than any other nation, should help steer Sri Lanka towards realising its potential, to reap the rewards of a stable, friendly neighbourhood.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Preventing Illegal Refuge<span class="p">: The state of Tamil Nadu has already started feeling the impact of the crisis with the reported arrival of 16 persons from Sri Lanka through illegal means. Tamil Nadu was home to nearly three lakh refugees after the anti-Tamil pogrom of 1983. The authorities, both in India and Sri Lanka, should ensure that the present crisis is not used to step up smuggling activities and trafficking or whip up emotions in both countries.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Crisis as an Opportunity<span class="p">: Neither Sri Lanka nor India can afford to have strained ties. As a much larger country, the onus is on India, it needs to be extremely patient and engage Sri Lanka even more regularly and closely. There is also a need to step up our people-centric developmental activities while scrupulously staying clear of any interference in Colombo’s domestic affairs.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/palk-bay-scheme-and-marine-fisheries-bill" style=" color: black; font-family:Calibri, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 30pt;" target="_blank">The crisis should be used as an opportunity for New Delhi and Colombo to thrash out a solution to the </a><a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/palk-bay-scheme-and-marine-fisheries-bill" class="a" target="_blank">Palk </a>Bay fisheries dispute - a longstanding irritant in bilateral ties.</h1></body></html>
