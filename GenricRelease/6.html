Electrification of the transport sector can also bring benefits in terms of <b>increased energy efficiency and reduced local pollution. </b>However, there are genuine concerns about meeting the future energy demand for charging EV batteries with clean and renewable sources. More importantly, the issue of long-term sustainability of EVs is underscored by the supply risks of critical material resources used in the EV batteries. Extraction of some of these material resources are linked to significant environmental impacts as well as social and ethical issues.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reducing emissions from fossil fuels</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/greenhouse-gases" class="a" target="_blank">When fossil fuels are burned, they release carbon dioxide and other </a>greenhouse gases, which in turn trap heat in our atmosphere, <b>making them the primary contributors</b></p><h1 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/global-warming-overview" class="s5" target="_blank">to global </a><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/topic/climate-change" class="s5" target="_blank">warming and climate </a>change<a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/syria-to-join-paris-climate-agreement-leaves-united-states-isolated-spd/" class="a" target="_blank">.

Considering the world&#39;s continuing dependence on fossil fuels, many argue that in addition to efforts aimed at replacing them, we also need <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/carbon-capture-trees-atmosphere-climate-change" class="s5" target="_blank">to suck </a><b>carbon from the air with technologies such as carbon capture</b>, in which emissions</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">are diverted <b>to underground storage or recycled before they reach the atmosphere</b><a href="https://www.power-technology.com/features/carbon-capture-cost/" class="a" target="_blank">. A handful of commercial-scale projects around the world already capture carbon dioxide from the smokestacks of fossil fuel-fired plants, and while its high costs have prevented wider </a>adoption, advocates hope advances in the technology will eventually make it more affordable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Paris Agreement, 2015</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Paris Agreement is a <b>legally binding international treaty on climate change</b>.

Electric vehicles use <b>electricity to charge their batteries instead of using fossil fuels </b>like petrol or diesel. Electric vehicles are more efficient, and that combined with the electricity cost means that charging an electric vehicle is cheaper than filling petrol or diesel</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">for your travel requirements. <b>Using renewable energy sources can make the use of electric vehicles more eco-friendly</b>.

The servicing requirements for electric vehicles are lesser than the conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. Therefore, the yearly cost of running an electric vehicle is significantly low.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zero Tailpipe Emissions</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Driving an electric vehicle can help you reduce your <b>carbon footprint because there will be zero tailpipe emissions</b>.

These problems can easily be overcome with an electric vehicle. Simply plug your vehicle in at your home charger for 4-5 hours before you plan to go. If you are <b>able to get a charger where you park at home, it is very convenient to plan your journeys in advance. </b>What if you forget to plug in your machine someday? Then you can easily take the help of fast chargers or even battery swapping services if you are on a two-wheeler on the road.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No noise pollution</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Electric vehicles have the silent functioning capability as there is <b>no engine under the hood</b>. No engine means no noise. The electric motor functions so silently that you need to peek into your instrument panel to check if it is ON. <b>Electric vehicles are so silent that manufacturers have to add false sounds in order to make them safe for pedestrians.</b></p></body></html>
