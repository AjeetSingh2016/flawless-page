As one example, Ukraine is a major source of inert gasses, such as neon required for the semiconductor lithography process, and any disruption in the supply of neon and other noble gasses from the country could trigger shortages and associated cost inflation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Russia is an important producer of metals like aluminum, nickel and copper. Aluminum is a conductor that is commonly used to manufacture passive components and in wire bonding. Passive components, such as resistors and capacitors, are commonly used in all types of electronic equipment. Any disruption in the supply of any of these metals could cause prices to rise and subsequently impact the prices of semiconductor devices and electronic systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/power-of-the-profession-blog/preparing-for-the-worst-is-the-best-logistics-strategy/?_ga=2.13436343.1448389505.1646659077-1757672702.1619205654" class="a" target="_blank">However, it is important to note that most chip manufacturers have contingency plans, such as diversifying suppliers and maintaining high levels of inventory. As such, we don’t expect to see an immediate impact. But still, panic buying and rising costs of transportation and </a>logistics could lead to higher prices across the board.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 236pt;text-indent: -221pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">New U.S. government rules aim to fatally undermine China’s semiconductor fabrication<span class="h1"> </span>capabilities</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Understanding the different sides of that bet requires looking at the different layers of restrictions and the knock-on effects they’re likely to have around the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-zte-commerce-idINKBN1HN1R0" class="a" target="_blank">The first layer involved the direct sale of American-fabricated semiconductors to specific Chinese companies, initially </a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-17/u-s-places-huawei-and-67-affiliates-around-world-on-blacklist" class="a" target="_blank">ZTE and then </a><a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/lists-of-parties-of-concern/entity-list" class="a" target="_blank">Huawei. This happened when each of the firms was added to the Commerce Department’s Entity </a><a href="https://sanctionsnews.bakermckenzie.com/commerce-department-terminates-zte-denial-order-issued-april-15-2018/" class="a" target="_blank">List, which bans companies from buying controlled U.S. exports without a license. (ZTE was </a><a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-and-investment-policy-watch/how-trumps-export-curbs-semiconductors-and-equipment-hurt#_ftn13" class="a" target="_blank">later removed.) But that move proved ineffective at cutting off Huawei’s access to the advanced semiconductors used in 5G equipment, because the company could </a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-us-approves-licenses-huawei-buy-auto-chips-sources-2021-08-25/" class="a" target="_blank">still purchase advanced logic chips from foreign fabrication facilities, known as fabs, in Taiwan or South Korea. American firms were also sometimes </a>granted licenses to sell low-end chips to Huawei.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/perspectives-events/publications/2020/08/tightening-the-screws-us-further-restricts-huaweis-access-to-us-technologies" class="a" target="_blank">To plug some of these holes, controls on Huawei were then expanded to </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/" class="a" target="_blank">include a new Entity List Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR), which requires companies that use controlled U.S. technology in their production processes to comply with U.S. export restrictions. In this case, the change meant that any company in the world that uses U.S. technology to fabricate chips must apply for a license in order to sell to Huawei. Almost every part of the global semiconductor supply chain has significant U.S. inputs, so FDPR effectively allowed the U.S. government to force the rest of the world to comply with its own export controls on Huawei. Over the following years, the U.S. government added many </a>more Chinese institutions to the Entity List, including many with ties to military or surveillance activities, though it did not apply the expanded FDPR to all of them. These restrictions dealt a heavy blow to Huawei and lesser blows to the other companies targeted, but the rules only remained meaningful so long as China was unable to fabricate its own cutting-edge chips. In order to maintain that status quo, the United States had to slow down China’s efforts to indigenize semiconductor fabrication capabilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asml-holding-usa-china-insight/trump-administration-pressed-dutch-hard-to-cancel-china-chip-equipment-sale-sources-idUSKBN1Z50HN" class="a" target="_blank">To do that, the U.S. government dealt with the second layer of the supply chain: semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME), the highly specialized tools that fabs use to make chips. In a key early moment in 2018, the U.S. government successfully lobbied the </a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/18/china-smic-entity-list-ban/" class="a" target="_blank">Dutch government to not grant the necessary licenses for Dutch firm ASML to sell its most advanced equipment to Chinese fabs. Over the following years, Washington placed China’s leading </a>fab on the Entity List, further restricting its access to crucial SME. Restrictions on SME proved particularly durable because these are often extremely specialized tools, requiring years or even decades of development. They are also produced by just a handful of firms in countries that are all U.S. allies, meaning coordination with allies can prove particularly potent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/CSET-Silicon-Twist-1.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">A debate emerged in national security and foreign policy communities over whether the United States should </a>pull the trigger on more drastic restrictions that would limit the sale of any advanced AI chips to China.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There were two schools of thoughts in foreign policy Analysts</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/CSET-Silicon-Twist-1.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">whether the United States should pull the </a><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/silicon-twist/" class="a" target="_blank">trigger on more drastic restrictions that would limit the sale of any advanced AI chips to China. That line of reasoning was bolstered by revelations that, despite long-standing bans on sales for military applications, the People’s Liberation Army used an array of intermediate and shell companies to continue </a>purchasing advanced AI chips that were designed by American firms and fabricated in Taiwan and South Korea.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">But other foreign policy analysts pushed back, arguing that far more extensive bans on advanced chip exports to China could accelerate the time line for China to develop fully indigenous supply chains for chips.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">India and semiconductor market</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">India currently imports all chips and the market is estimated to touch <b>$100 billion by 2025 </b>from $24 billion now. However, for the domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips, India has recently launched several initiatives:</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Union Cabinet has allocated an amount of <b>₹76,000 crore </b>for supporting the development of a ‘semiconductors and display manufacturing ecosystem’.

However, the government has looked to woo foreign chipmakers. ISMC Digital, a consortium of investors, is planning to build a $3 billion manufacturing facility in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/vedanta-foxconn-sign-mou-with-modis-home-state-20-bln-chip-foray-2022-09-13/" class="a" target="_blank">Tower Semiconductor, an Israeli company, would be the technology partner on that project. Meanwhile, Foxconn, the Taiwanese firm that assembles Apple’s iPhones, and Indian mining </a>company Vedanta have teamed up to build a $19.5 billion chipmaking facility in India. However, the ISMC Digital plant will be making older generation chips, often called trailing-edge semiconductors, rather than the cutting-edge components made by the likes of TSMC.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are the Issues Regarding Domestic Manufacturing of Semiconductors</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dominance of Certain Countries<span class="p">: The semiconductor manufacturing capacities</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">are concentrated in a few geographies. Nearly all leading edge (sub 10nm) semiconductor manufacturing capacity is limited to Taiwan and South Korea, with nearly 92% located in the former. Further, 75% of the semiconductor manufacturing capacity is concentrated</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">in East Asia and China.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The concentration of capacities poses many challenges, leading several countries to be vulnerable to a few. The short point is that there could be moments of stress and conflict between India and the major powers. In order to preserve the capacity to stay autonomous, India needs not just smart alliances but also indigenous capability.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Pursuing Western Companies<span class="p">: Although India has a decent chip design talent, it never built up chip fab capacity.
