      Truly speaking, the public sector enterprises have been set up not merely
      out of ideological considerations of building a socialistic pattern of
      society. This is in view of the fact that the private sector is not only
      hesitant, but also incapable, of building social overhead capital. In a
      mixed economy framework, the two sectors are expected to play a
      complementary role. But what happened in India during the planning period
      was that the public sector acted as a feeder to the private sector, in
      spite of inefficiencies of the former.

      Furthermore, loss of public sector helps private sector to accumulate
      profits. That is why, in the early 1990s, a question cropped up in the

      bear losses by merely playing the complementary role?

      An argument often advanced by them is that, over time, private sector
      industries in India have attained a fair degree of maturity. Investment
      potentiality, as well as managerial efficiency, of these industries are no
      less inferior to those of public sector industries. Hence, the necessity

      In the light of failure of the public sector and success of the private
      sector industries, demand for privatisation of the public sector came to
      the forefront when the Cong. (I) Government under the
      <b>leadership of P.V. Narasimha Rao came to power in 1991</b>. This was
      the time when the then socialist country U.S.S.R. embarked upon economic
      reforms under the banner ‘Perestroika’ (meaning ‘reconstruction’ or
      ‘restructuring’ of the economic system) aimed at

          The issue of privatisation has come to the forefront due to the poor
          performance of several public sector enterprises and the consequent
          huge fiscal deficits faced by the government. Since the government has
          to give fiscal support to losing public concerns, the fiscal deficit
          of the government kept on mounting year after year. One specific step
          that has been taken to reduce the deficit was privatisation, through
          an <b>act of disinvestment</b>, i.e.,
          <b>selling of public sector equity to mutual funds</b>, financial
          institutions and the private sector.

          The privatisation process began in 1991-92 with the sale of minority
          stakes in some PSUs. From 1999-2000 onwards, the focus has been
          shifted to strategic sales. As a part of strategic sales, the
          government plans to ensure that at least for a period of one year
          after privatisation there would be no retrenchment of employees.

          Another major shift in disinvestment policy was made in 2004-05 when
          it was decided that the government may “dilute its equity and raise
          resources to meet the social needs of the people”— a distinct
          departure from strategic sales.

          1999-2000 and 2003-04, the emphasis on disinvestment changed in favour

          One can conclude from this move of the Government that the private
          sector industries in India are not inefficient as public sector
          industries. Administrative and managerial  inefficiency are the hallmarks of public sector industries. Government
          is unable to run these high cost public sector industries. Unable to

          Privatization is making a huge impact on the Indian economy. During

          Ultimately, privatization is no guarantee to lesser corruption as it
          has been a part of the private sector too. In fact, where the
          corruption levels are high in government, there is a higher degree of
          market concentration and the prices also go up.

          The magnitude of divestment and the nature of assets being privatized
          sometimes make things more vulnerable to corruption. Privatization can
          also be instrumentalized for personal or political gains. It is only
          good if the state obtains a fair value for the state assets for its
          taxpayers. A few sectors like oil and gas, energy, mining,
          transportation, etc. are more are susceptible to corruption and
          illegal practices because these are high-value procurement projects.
          So, it is important to get the privatization right, without indulging
          in irregular practices; because a failed privatization drive may have
          far-reaching consequences.

          Finally, privatization may reduce corruption but cannot be the best
          solution to eradicate this vice. There are both sides to this thought.
          While some researchers establish that privatization lessens
          corruption, others believe that it can also induce corruption. With
          the optimized use of Privatization, we can reduce corruption and its
          further spread in India.
