Even after about 50 years, Indian women continued to have unsafe abortions and face adverse and fatal consequences. At this point, only legislative amendments may not be sufficient but along with that, many other aspects need to be considered like awareness, availability, accessibility, affordability of quality MTP services, and contraceptives. People should know the adverse effects of taking unsupervised medical termination pills. Comprehensive abortion care should be provided at every level of health care to ensure the good reproductive health of the women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Complications arising from spontaneous and unsafe induced abortion are recognized worldwide as a major public health concern and are one of the important attributes of influencing maternal morbidity and mortality (ACOG 2009). In 1964, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare constituted <b>Shanti Lal Shah Committee </b>to investigate the <b>causes of the increasing number of abortion cases. </b>Then, in 1970, this Committee recommended the MTP Bill, which was passed in August 1971 as the <b>Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act</b>. In all types of abortions including medical abortion also, it is always recommended to be supervised by trained health care providers with a medical prescription. Medical abortion with <b>mifepristone and misoprostol (Abortion Pills) </b>is a very safe option for termination of pregnancy when consumed under medical supervision with a success rate of 92%–97%.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The <b>amendment done in 2002 </b>allows medication abortion up to <b>7 weeks gestation</b>. In 2003, it was further amended allowing certified providers to <b>prescribe medication abortion drugs </b>outside of a registered facility as long as emergency facilities were available to them. Despite such clear guidelines and recommendations, self-administration of these drugs by pregnant women has become highly prevalent due to the availability of these drugs over the counter. Many women depend on medical abortion and consider it as a method of spacing between pregnancies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Till 2017, there was a dichotomous classification of abortion as safe and unsafe. However, with abortion technology now becoming safer, this has been replaced by a three-tier classification, which is as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l1"><li data-list-text=""><h1 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: left;">Safe abortion<span class="p">: Provided by healthcare workers and with methods recommended by the WHO</span></h1></li><li data-list-text=""><h1 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Less safe abortion<span class="p">: Done by trained providers using non-recommended methods or using a safe method (e.g., misoprostol) but without adequate information or support from a trained individual</span></h1></li><li data-list-text=""><h1 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Least safe abortion<span class="p">: Done by a trained provider using dangerous, invasive methods.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Burdening of Unsafe Abortion</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8575235/#ref12" class="s2" target="_blank">Even after 50 years of MTP Act (1971), the scenario of unsafe abortions is very distressing. Almost 56% of abortions in India are under the category of unsafe. It was found that 15·6 million abortions (14·1 million–17·3 million) occurred in India in 2015. There were 3·4 million abortions (22%) carried out in health facilities and 11·5 million (73%) abortions were medication abortions done outside of health facilities, and 0·8 million (5%) abortions were done outside of health facilities using methods other than medication abortion. Overall, 12·7 million (81%) abortions were medication abortions, 2·2 million (14%) abortions were surgical, and 0·8 million (5%) abortions were done through other methods that were probably unsafe. Considering this huge burden of unsafe abortions, Rajya Sabha passed the MTP (Amendment) Bill, in 2021. The Bill was passed by the lower house in 2020.[</a>12] Salient features of this bill are:</p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Bill permits abortion to be allowed <b>up to 20 weeks on the opinion of just one medical practitioner</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">To terminate pregnancies <b>between 20 and 24 weeks</b>, the opinion of two doctors is required.

The Court remarked in</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">paragraph 17 that “if the wife has <b>consented to matrimonial sex and created sexual relations with her own husband</b>, it does not mean that she has consented to conceive a child.

The husband cannot compel her to conceive and give birth to his child”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Court further remarked in paragraph 22 of this High Court judgment that “A woman is <b>not a machine in which raw material </b>is put and a finished product comes out. She should be mentally prepared to conceive, continue the same and give birth to a child” and concluded that the <b>husband has no right to compel his wife not to terminate the pregnancy </b>and that he had no right to sue his wife for compensation. This was a</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">progressive step by the High Court as it considered the woman the “best judge” of whether or not to continue with a pregnancy. The Court recognised the personal right of a woman to continue with the pregnancy or abort the foetus given that it is her who must be to mentally prepared to carry out a pregnancy.</p></body></html>
