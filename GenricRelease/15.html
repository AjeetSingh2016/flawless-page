Bail, in law, means procurement of release from prison of a person awaiting trial or an appeal, by the deposit of security to ensure his submission at the required time to legal authority. The monetary value of the security, known also as the bail, or, more accurately, the bail bond, is set by the court having jurisdiction over the prisoner. The security may be cash, the papers giving title to property, or the bond of private persons of means or of a professional bondsman or bonding company. Failure of the person released on bail to surrender himself at the appointed time results in forfeiture of the security. Courts have greater discretion to grant or deny bail in the case of persons under criminal arrest.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The law lexicon<span class="s3">1</span> defines bail as the security for the appearance of the accused person on which he is released pending trial or investigation. What is contemplated by bail is to &quot;procure the release of a person from legal custody, by undertaking that he/she shall appear at the time and place designated and submit him/herself to the jurisdiction and judgment of the court”<span class="s3">2</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, does not define bail, although the terms bailable offence and non-bailable offence have been defined in section 2(a) Cr.P.C. as follows: &quot; Bailable offence means an offence which is shown as bailable in the First Schedule or which is made bailable by any other law for the time being enforce, and non-bailable offence means any other offence&quot;. Further,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">ss. 436 to 450 set out the provisions for the grant of bail and bonds in criminal cases. The amount of security that is to be paid by the accused to secure his release has not been mentioned in the Cr.P.C. Thus, it is the discretion of the court to put a monetary cap on the bond.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1"><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">Law lexicon by Ramanth Iyer, (3rd ed).</p></li><li data-list-text="2"><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">Black&#39;s Law Dictionary 177 (4th ed.)</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2011, The Hon&#39;ble apex court in <b>Sanjay Chandra vs CBI 3 </b>also</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">opined <span class="p">that:</span></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">“<i>The grant or refusal to grant bail lies within the discretion of the Court. The grant or denial is regulated, to a large extent, by the facts and circumstances of each particular case. But at the same time, right to bail is not to be denied merely because of the sentiments of the community against the accused. The primary purposes of bail in a criminal case are to relieve the accused of imprisonment, to relieve the State of the burden of keeping him, pending the trial, and at the same time, to keep the accused constructively in the custody of the Court, whether before or after conviction, to assure that he will submit to the jurisdiction of the Court and be in attendance thereon whenever his presence is required”.</i></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Recently, Hon’ble Supreme Court, in <b>Aasu vs. state of Rajastan (Criminal Appeal NO.511 of 2017 Dt.09-03-2017) </b>issued a direction that Bail applications shall be disposed of normally within one week.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bail for Bailable offences:</h2><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">According to section 436 of CrPC, If the offence alleged is bailable, then, the Accused is entitled for Bail as a matter of right, may be before Police station itself, or if forwarded to Magistrates Court, before Magistrates court. In bailable offences bail is a right and not a favour. In such offences there is no question of any discretion in granting bail. Bail can be claimed as of right and there is a statutory duty imposed upon the Police Officer as well as the Court to release a person on bail if he is prepared to give bail. Such a person can also be released on his own bond in a fit case. It is only where the accused is unable to furnish bail then he should be kept in detention.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Hon&#39;ble Supreme Court in a case<span class="s3">4</span> held that:</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">“As soon as it appears that the accused person is prepared to give bail, the police officer or the court before whom he offers to give bail, is bound to release him on such terms as to bail as may appear to the officer or the court to be reasonable.

A new section 436A<span class="s3">5</span> is inserted in the Code to provide that where an under trial prisoner other than the offence for which death has been prescribed as one of the punishments, has been under detention fora period extending to one half of the maximum period of imprisonment provided for the alleged offence, he should be released on his personal bond, with or without sureties. It is also provided that in no case the under trial be detained beyond the maximum period of imprisonment for which he can be convicted for the alleged offence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bail for non-Bailable offences:</h2><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The provisions of section 437 empower two authorities to consider the question of bail, namely (1) a court  and (2) an officer-in-charge of the police station who has arrested or detained without warrant a person accused or suspected of the commission of a non-bailable offence. Although this section deals with the power or discretion of a court as well as a police officer in charge of police station to grant bail in non- bailable offences it has also laid down certain restrictions on the power of a police officer to grant bail and certain rights of an accused person to obtain bail when he is being tried by a Magistrate. Section 437, Criminal Procedure Code, deals with the powers of the trial court and of the Magistrate to whom the offender is produced by the police or the accused surrenders or appears, to grant or refuse bail to person accused of,or suspected of the commission of any non-bailable offence.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The power to release on bail a person accused of a non-bailable offence is conferred upon only one class of police officers, namely an officer-in-charge of the Police Station under section 437 sub Section (I). Since the power to grant bail is permissive and not obligatory, it has to be exercised with great caution because of the risk and stakes involved. Before exercising his power, a station officer ought to satisfy himself that the release on bail would not prejudice the prosecution in bringing home the guilt of the accused. In case the officer in charge admits an accused to bail, it is mandatory for him to record the reasons or special reasons in the case diary and preserve the bail bonds until they are discharged either by the appearance of the accused in court or by the order of a competent court.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: justify;">For the purpose of bail in non-bailable offence, the Legislature has classified them under two heads:</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: justify;">(1) those which are punishable with death or imprisonment for life; (2)those which are not so punishable.</p><p style="padding-bottom: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: justify;">In case of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life a station officer cannot enlarge a person on bail, if there appears reasonable</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/></li><li data-list-text="5"><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">cr.p.c 2005 Amendment</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">grounds for believing that he has been guilty of such offence. The age or sex or sickness or infirmity of the accused cannot be considered by a police officer for the purpose of granting bail. These matters may be taken in view by a court only. An officer- in-charge of the police station may grant bail only when there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed a non-bailable offence or  when the non-bailable offence complained  of is not punishable with death or life imprisonment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Powers of the High Court or Court of Session in granting bail (section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973):</h2><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">According to Section 439(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a High Court or Court of Session may direct,—</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">(a) That any person accused of an offence and in custody be released on bail, and if the offence is of the nature specified in sub-section (3) of Section 437, may impose any condition which it considers necessary for the purposes mentioned in that sub-section;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: justify;">b) That any condition imposed by a Magistrate when releasing any person on bail be set aside or modified.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">However, the High Court or the Court of Sessions shall, before granting bail to a person who is accused of an offence which is triable exclusively by the Court  of  Sessions  or  which,  though  not  so  triable,  is  punishable  with imprisonment for life, give notice of the application for bail to the public prosecutor unless it is, for reasons to be recorded in writing of opinion that it is not practicable to give such notice.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: justify;">As per Section 439(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a High Court or Court of Sessions may direct that any person who has been released on bail under Chapter XXXIII (i.e., relating to bail) be arrested and commit him to custody.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The powers of the High Court in granting bail are very wide; even so where the offence is non-bailable, various considerations will have to be taken into account before bail is granted in case of non-bailable offence. Under Section 439(1) of the Code, the High Court can only release the accused in cases pending anywhere in the State on bail or reduce the amount of bail, but cannot order the arrest or commitment to custody of any person who has been released on bail by the lower Court but it can order to arrest the person who had been released on bail under Section 439(2) of the Code.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In a recent judgment<span class="s3">6</span>, Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that there are no restrictions on the High Court or Sessions Court to entertain an application for bail, provided, accused is in custody.

Section 437(5) states that any court which has released a person on bail under sub-section (1) or sub-s. (2) of s. 437, may, if it considers it necessary so to do, direct that such person be arrested and commit him to custody. Similarly s. 439 confers on the High Court and the Court of Session power to cancel bail. Section 439(2) The Code of Criminal Procedure makes clear provisions for cancellation of bail and taking accused back in custody.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: justify;">The power of cancellation of bail can be resorted to broadly in the following two situations:</p><ol id="l3"><li data-list-text="(i)"><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 32pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">On merits of a case mainly on the ground of the order granting bail being perverse, or passed without due application of mind or in violation of any substantive or procedural law; and</p></li><li data-list-text="(ii)"><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 32pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">On the ground of misuse of liberty after the grant of bail or other supervening circumstances.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Bail in the first type of cases can be cancelled by superior courts only, whereas in the second category of cases bail can be cancelled by the very court which may have granted bail. There appears to be confusion galore in the judicial pronouncements on the aspect of cancellation of bail on merits and on the ground of subsequent conduct of accused already on bail or on the ground of supervening circumstances. Sometimes the principles of cancellation of bail on the ground of subsequent conduct or intervention of new circumstances have been wrongly brought in and applied to the cases where cancellation of bail is sought on the merits of the case. It is therefore necessary to clearly understand the aforesaid distinct principles of cancellation of bail operating in these two different fields.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">As stated herein above the legal provisions pertaining to cancellation of bail under Cr.P.C are mainly contained in S.437 (5) and 439(2).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Section 437(5) provides for the cancellation of bail by a court other than a High Court or a Sessions Court. Meaning thereby it confers power of cancellation on the Magistrate court. It states that a court other than High court or Sessions Court, may, if it considers necessary to do so, direct that a person released on bail by it be arrested and committed to custody. By judicial pronouncements this provision has been interpreted to mean that any court that has released the accused on bail has power to direct arrest of such person and commit him to custody if subsequent to the release on bail, the circumstances justify to do so. Ordinarily the court would be entitled to exercise this power only where the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">person released on bail is guilty of misuse of the liberty granted by the court or where there is new development in the investigation or recovery of cogent material prima facie involving accused with heinous crime. However, bail once granted should not be cancelled in a mechanical manner without considering whether any supervening circumstances have rendered it no longer conducive to a fair trial to allow the accused to retain his freedom by enjoying the concession of bail during the trial.</p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Cancellation of bail- certain grounds:</h2><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The grounds for cancellation of bail under ss. 437(5) and 439(2) are identical, namely, bail granted under S.437(1) or (2) or s.439(1) can be cancelled where the accused (1) misuses his liberty by indulging in similar criminal activity, (2) interferes with the course of investigation, (3) attempts to tamper with evidence of witnesses, (4) threatens witnesses or indulges in similar activities which would hamper smooth investigation, (5) attempts to flee to another country, (6) attempts to make himself scarce by going underground or becoming unavailable to the investigating agency, (7) attempts to place himself beyond the reach of his surety, etc. These grounds are illustrative and not exhaustive.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Section 439(2) confers powers on the High Court and the Sessions Court to direct re-arrest of the accused who might have been released on bail by any court and commit him to custody. A comparison of s. 439(2) and s. 437(5) makes it clear that the powers of cancellation of bail vested in the High Court and the Sessions Court are very wide <i>vis--vis </i>the powers of the Magistrate court.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">s. 439(2) confers powers of cancellation of bail on the High Court and the Sessions Court in respect of orders of bail passed itself as well as by any court subordinate to it also. The power to cancel an order of bail passed by itself by the High Court or the Sessions Court as the case may be, can usually be exercised only where the person released on bail is guilty of misuse of the liberty granted by the court or there is substantial change in the facts of a case. However so far as the cancellation of bail order passed by a court subordinate to it is concerned no such restricted interpretation is justified. Section 439(2) clearly provides that any person who has been released on bail <i>under this Chapter </i>may be arrested and committed to custody by a High Court or Court of Sessions. So it is legally permissible to a High Court or a Court of Session to review and examine an order of bail passed by a court subordinate to it on merits and decide whether such order is legally sustainable or not.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Magistrate has power to pass the subsequent order altering or amending or deleting the conditions of the earlier bail order in any manner whatsoever. Section 437 (5) of Cr.P.C. impliedly confers such power on him. When the Magistrate is conferred with the power to cancel his order, then, as a logical</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">7</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">corollary, it follows that he does have the power as well to amend or effect necessary alterations, short of cancellation, in the earlier bail order passed by him<span class="s3">7</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">It is now a settled law that complainant can always question the order granting bail if the said order is not validly passed. It is not as if once a bail is granted by any court, the only way is to get it cancelled on account of its misuse. The bail order can be tested on merits also<span class="s3">8</span>. Bail already granted cannot be cancelled on the ground that police needs custodial interrogation of the accused.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Anticipatory bail (Section 438 Cr.P.c):</h2><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The  post-emergency  year  has  witnessed  a  spate  of  petitions  for anticipatory bail. The petitioners were in many cases influential persons who had wielded enormous powers during emergency and who were, in the post-emergency era, apprehensive of arrests on the charges of corruption, misuse or abuse of official positions, <i>etc. </i>The persons involved in the anticipatory bail proceedings being rich and mighty, they made every effort to use the law and its machinery to their maximum advantage. In this process the courts were required  to  interpret  the  law  discreetly  and  with  great  precision  and circumspection. The law relating to anticipatory bail has received, thereby, impetus in the process of its growth and sophistication.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Right to life and personal liberty is an important right granted to all the citizens under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution and it is considered as one of the precious right. Under Indian criminal law, there is a provision for anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code 1973.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The Law Commission of India, in its 41st Report dated September 24, 1969 pointed out the necessity of introducing a provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure enabling the High Court and the Court of Sessions to grant “anticipatory bail”. This provision allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of an arrest on accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence. The very basic purpose of insertion of this provision was that no person should be confined in any way until and unless held guilty.</p><h2 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Anticipatory bail under criminal code of procedure</h2><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Where any person has a reason to believe that he may be arrested on accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence, he may apply to the High Court or the Court of Session for a direction under this section that in the event of such arrest he shall be released on bail and the court shall provide him anticipatory bail after taking into consideration the following factors, namely-</p><ol id="l4"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">the nature and gravity of the accusation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/></li></ol></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="7"><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">Brijesh Singh v.

Deprivation of personal liberty must be founded on the most serious considerations relevant to welfare objectives of the society as specified in the Constitution. Even though the law of the land and Hon’ble Higher courts in various cases have tried to intervene and also have laid down certain guidelines to be followed but unfortunately nothing has been done about it. There is also a strong need felt for a complete review of the bail system keeping in mind the socio-economic condition of the majority of our population. While granting bail the court must also look at the socio-economic plight of the accused and must also have a compassionate attitude towards them. A proper scrutiny may be done to determine whether the accused has his roots in the community which would deter him from fleeing from the court.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">“Society has a vital interest in grant or refusal of bail because every criminal offence is an offence against the state. The order <span class="p">granting or refusing bail </span>must reflect perfect balance between the conflicting interests, namely, sanctity of individual liberty and the interest of the society”.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">– <b>Justice Dalveer Bhandari </b>in S.S.
