      This was first clearly defined in the case of
      <b>M.R. Balaji v. State of Mysore </b>wherein the court realised that the
      constitution-makers did assume the fact the reservation policy would not
      be misused to provide unreasonable, excessive or extravagant reservation.
      Breaching the <b>50% ceiling </b>would hence result in a reverse
      discrimination process. <br><br> However, subsequent case of
      <b>State Of Kerala vs N. M. Thomas &amp; Ors, 1976 </b>assumed a different
      view. This was also realized later when the Second Backward Classes
      Commission popularly known as the Mandal Commission came in picture in the
      year 1979 wherein it suggested the introduction of reservation for Other
      Backward Castes category. The court <b>capped it to 27% </b>while

      The same is envisaged by the Constitution only for socially and

      had never been in contemplation for this action of reservation. The
      expression <b>‘economically weaker sections of citizens’ </b>is not a

      is not merely a state of stagnation but is a point of regression. The

      In this backdrop, the insertion of enabling provisions, within the
      framework of the Constitution of India, to remedy the evil effects of
      poverty by way of reservation, is primarily to be regarded as a part of
      the frontal efforts to eradicate poverty
      <b>‘in all its forms everywhere’</b>. the question arises as to whether
      the said segment could be denied of the State support by way of
      affirmative action of reservation only because of the fact that that
      segment is otherwise <b>not suffering from other disadvantages</b>. The
      answer could only be in the negative for, in the State’s efforts of
      ensuring all-inclusive socio-economic justice, there cannot be competition
      of claims for affirmative action based on disadvantages in the manner that
      one disadvantaged section would seek denial of affirmative action for
      another disadvantaged section.

      A long deal of arguments by the learned counsel challenging the amendment

      reservation for EWS on the ground that it exceeds the
      <b>ceiling limit of fifty per cent</b>. laid down by this Court in the
      consistent series of cases. Apart that this argument is not precisely in
      conformity with the law declared by this Court, it runs counter to the
      other argument that this EWS reservation is invalid because of exclusions.
      If at all the cap of fifty per cent. is the final and inviolable rule, the
      classes already standing in the enabled bracket of fifty per cent. cannot
      justifiably claim their share in the extra ten percent.

      The fifty percent. ceiling proposition would obviously be applied only to
      those reservations which were in place before the amendment in question.
      No decision of this Court could be read to mean that even if the
      Parliament finds the necessity of another affirmative action by the State
      in the form of reservation for a section or class in need, it could never
      be provided.

      As noticed, the case of <b>N.M. Thomas </b>arose in the context of
      constitutionality of the rules contained in the
      <b>Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules, 1958</b>, by which the
      State Government was empowered to grant exemption to SC/ST candidates from
      passing qualifying test for departmental exam. In that case, two learned
      judges opined about the rule of ceiling limit thus:

      Suppose for instance a State has a large number of backward classes of
      citizens which constitute 80% of the population and the Government, in
      order to give them proper representation, reserves 80% of the jobs for
      them, can it be said that the percentage of reservation is bad and
      violates the permissible limits of clause (4) of Article 16?
