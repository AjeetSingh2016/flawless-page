It was held that the Maratha community is not socially and educationally backward to be brought under the umbrella of reservation. This Supreme Court decision is excruciating for the ruling party of Maharashtra but the Supreme Court found no merit in the Maratha claim of backwardness. <b>Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018 </b>In 2018 Maharashtra Assembly passed a bill proposing 16% reservation for Maratha Community.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In 2019, the Bombay High Court while upholding the reservation pointed out that instead of 16% it should be reduced to 12% in education and 13% in jobs. The court has now repudiated the High Court decision and its reasoning that the denial of status of backward class, has pushed them deeper into a social and educational backwardness and made them eligible to ask for reservation. A five-judge constitution bench unanimously concluded that this reservation is unconstitutional on many grounds including breaching of the 50% quota rule fixed by the Supreme Court earlier in <b>Indira Sawhney v. Union of India case</b>. Also the Supreme Court noticed that “States have no ability to add any standing to the socially financially in reverse position list because of the change made by parliament. “Only the President can add the position to the SEBC list guided by the National Backward Classes Commission.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History of Marathas</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">They are mainly peasants and landowners and form nearly one-third of the population of the state. If we dig deep into the historical aspect of Marathas then they have been known as a ‘warrior’ caste with large land holdings. The Maratha people are a politically dominant community in Maharashtra. Notwithstanding the political dominance over the years, due</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">to rising agrarian crisis and land division there was a decline of financial stability among the middle class and lower middle class of the Maratha community.
