      A government of a country spends money for the development of its country.
      The Government receives money
      <b>from the various types of taxes the people pay. </b>Now, what happens
      in most of the cases is that the
      <b>expenditure of the Government exceeds its income. </b>To deal with it,
      Governments ask the central bank of that country to print more money. This

      But though this <b>pumps more money into the country’s economy</b>, it
      reduces the value of money that was already in circulation in the country.
      Let me explain this with the help of an example –
      <b>Imagine there is Rs. 100 in circulation in the market </b>and you own 1
      Rupee. In mathematical terms,
      <b>you own 1% of the money in the country</b>. If the Government prints
      more money and now the total amount of money in circulation goes up to Rs.
      200, the value of your
      <b>money would go down to 0.5% of the entire market share</b>. That’s a
      decrease of <b>50% in the value of your saved money</b>.
