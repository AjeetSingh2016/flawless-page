      The apparent contradiction between these two declarations should first be
      resolved. Section 133 is a clear authorisation to the courts to convict on
      the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, but since such a witness,
      being criminal himself, may not always be trustworthy, the court are
      guided by the illustration appended to Section 114 that, if it is
      necessary the court should presume that he is unreliable unless his
      statement are supported or verified by some independent evidence.

      Under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India, 1950 no accused shall be
      compelled to be a witness against himself. But as an accomplice accepts a
      pardon of his free will on condition of a true disclosure, in his own
      interest and is not compelled to give self-incriminating evidence the law
      in Sections 306 and 308, Code of Criminal Procedure is not affected. So a
      pardoned accused is bound to make a full disclosure and on his failure to
      do so he may be tried of the offence originally charged and his statement
      may be used against him under Section 308.

      Reading <b>Section 133 </b>of the Evidence Act along with
      <b>Section 114(b) </b>it is clear that the most important issue with
      respect to accomplice evidence is that of corroboration. The general rule
      regarding corroboration that has emerged is not a rule of law but merely a
      rule of practice which has acquired the force of rule of law in both India
      and England. The rule states that: A conviction based on the
      uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is not illegal but according to
      prudence it is not safe to rely upon uncorroborated evidence of an
      accomplice and thus judges and juries must exercise extreme caution and
      care while considering uncorroborated accomplice evidence.

      Like the Supreme Court has laid down what is known as theory of
      <b>“double test” </b>in the case of
      <b>Sarwan Singh v. State of Punjab</b>. In this case Sarwan Singh who was
      the third accused, was tried along with two others, i.e. Gurdayal Singh
      and Harbans Singh, under Section 302 for the murder of one Gurdev Singh
      who was the brother of the first accused, Harbans Singh. The case was that
      Sarwan Singh along with Gurdayal Singh and Banta Singh, who became an
      approver later on , caused the death of Gurdev Singh and all the accused
      were convicted on the basis of the evidence of Banta Singh. So the
      evidence of Accomplice is subject to corroboration.

      Secondly the court seeks corroboration of the approver’s evidence with

      the crime. The corroboration need not be direct evidence of the commission

      The Courts in this country have by harmoniously reading Section 114(b) and
      Section 133 together laid down the guiding principle with respect to
      accomplice evidence which clearly lays down the law without any ambiguity.
      This principle which the courts have evolved is that though a conviction
      based upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is not illegal or
      unlawful but the rule of prudence says that it is unsafe to act upon the
      evidence of an accomplice unless it is corroborated with respect to
      material aspects so as to implicate the accused.

      This guiding principle though very clear is often faced with difficulties
      with respect to its implementation. While implementing this principle
      different judges might have different levels of corroboration for
      accomplice evidence and thus with no hard and fast rules relating to the
      extent and nature of corroboration an element of subjectiveness creeps in
      which can result in injustice.
