      The definition of strict liability was first adopted in the late 1800s. It
      arose from the principle of incompetence, which commonly
      <b>applies to reckless conduct</b>. It entails the duty of responsibility
      with the violation of the duty resulting in harm to neighbours. When the
      defendant is found to be negligent, he or she is held liable to pay the
      complainant for the damages incurred. In contrast, under
      <b
        >absolute liability, the defendant is found liable regardless of whether
        or not he was negligent.</b

      The immateriality of intention and due care is the fine line that sets out
      strict liability from negligence. The court allows the defendant to engage
      in such risk imposing activities as long he stands ready to compensate
      those inflicted. If this rule ceased to exist, it would bring an unequal
      balance of rights between the wrongdoer and the victim.

          The Courts usually use a fact-based test in determining the
          &#39;dangerous thing&#39; to form an analysis as to whether the thing
          is likely to cause danger or mischief if it escaped into the land&#39;s surroundings. strict liability has three
          categories that include animals both owned or possessed abnormally
          dangerous activities, and product liability.

          noxious fumes, electricity, flag poles, etc are some examples
          considered to be dangerous things. The Cambridge Water v. Eastern

          were foreseeable by the defendant.

      This, rule <b>(Ryland v. Fletcher) evolved in the 19th century </b>at a
      time when all these developments of science and technology had not taken
      place cannot afford any guidance in evolving any standard of liability
      consistent with the constitutional norm and the needs of the present day
      economy and social structure. We do not feel inhibited by this rule which
      was evolved in the context of a totally different kind of economy. Law has
      to grow in order to satisfy the needs of the fast changing society and
      keep abreast with the economic developments, taking place in this country.

      As new situations arise the law has to be evolved in order to meet the
      challenge of such new situations. Law cannot allow our judicial thinking
      to be constrained by reference of the law as it prevails in England or for
      the matter of that in other foreign legal order. We in India cannot hold
      our hands back and I venture to evolve a new principle of liability which
      English courts have not done.&quot; So Supreme Court evolved a new rule creating
      absolute liability for harm caused by dangerous substance. The following
      statement of Bhagwati, C.J. which laid down the new principle may be
      noted:

      &quot;We are of the view that an enterprise, which is
      <b>engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous industry </b>which poses a
      potential threat to the health and safety of the persons working in the
      factory and residing in the surrounding areas owes an Absolute and non-<b
        >delegatable duty to the community </b
      >to ensure that no harm results to anyone on account of hazardous or
      inherently dangerous activity which it has undertaken. The enterprise must
      be held to be under an obligation to
      <b>provide that the hazardous or inherently dangerous </b>activity in
      which it is engaged must be conducted with the highest standards of safety
      and if any harm results on account of such activity the enterprise must be
      absolutely liable to compensate for such harm and it should be no answer
      to enterprise to say that it has taken all
      <b>reasonable care and that the harm occurred </b>without any negligence
      on its part.&quot;

      The Court also laid down that the measure of compensation payable within
      the capacity of the enterprise, so that the same can have the deterrent
      effect. The Court held that &quot;We would also like to point out that the
      measure of compensation in the kind of eases referred to must be
      <b>correlated to the magnitude and capacity of the enterprise </b>because
      such compensation must have a deterrent effect. The large and more
      prosperous the enterprise, greater must be the amount of the compensation
      payable by it for the harm caused on account of an accident in the
      carrying on the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity by the
      enterprise.

      The rule laid down in MC Mehta was also approved by the Apex Court in
      <b>Charan Lal Sahu v Union of India </b>The Court pointed out that that
      this rule is &#39;absolute and non-delegable&#39; and the enterprise
      cannot escape liability by showing that it has taken reasonable care and
      there was no negligence on its part.

      The Supreme Court also explained the basis of this rule as follows: - If
      an enterprise is permitted to carry on an hazardous or inherently
      dangerous activity for its profit, the law must presume that such
      <b>permission is conditional on the enterprise </b>absorbing the court of
      any accident (including
      <b>indemnification of all those who suffer harm in the accident</b>)
      arising on account of such hazardous or inherently dangerous activity as
      an appropriate item of its overheads; and -The enterprise alone has the
      resource to discover and guard against hazards or dangers and to provide a
      warning against potential hazards.
