Assault in English law is an attempt to cause injury to another and whoever by show of force and gestures creates a reasonable apprehension of danger to life or limb in the mind of another is guilty of assault. As per <b>Ratanlal Dhiraj Lal: The Indian Penal Code, 22nd Edition, 2010 </b>Hurt is equivalent to battery in English Law, Assault falls roughly in two classes (a) those which occasion actual bodily harm, and (b) those in which actual bodily harm is not essential.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hurt under Section 319 of IPC, 1860</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Hurt may be defined as the bodily pain which is caused by actual contact with the body by an aggravated assault There is no radical difference between assault and hurt. As per section 319 of IPC, “<b>Whoever causes bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person is said to cause hurt</b>”. The section does not define the offence of causing hurt. It defines only the term hurt and does not describe the circumstances under which it may be caused.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Essentials to section 319 of IPC <span class="h1">-</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1."><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Bodily Pain: <span class="p">The pain must be bodily and </span>not mental<span class="p">. A person, causing bodily pain to another, is said to cause ‘hurt’. Where the direct result of an act is the causing of bodily pain it is hurt whatever be the means employed to cause it. A person who deliberately sets out to cause shock to somebody with a weak heart and succeeds in doing so, he is said to have caused hurt. Any bodily pain due to the administration of drugs will be covered under ‘hurt’. When the injury is not serious and there is no intention to cause death, or grievous hurt, the accused would be guilty of causing hurt only, even though death is caused. This section does not define any offence.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">It merely states what is the meaning of &#39;hurt&#39;. The expression &#39;bodily pain&#39; means that the pain must be physical as opposed to any mental pain. So, mentally or emotionally hurting somebody will not be &#39;hurt&#39; within the meaning of this section. However, in order to come within this section, it is not necessary that any visible injury should be caused on the victim. All that the section contemplates is the causing of bodily pain. The degree or severity of the pain is not a material factor to decide whether this section will apply or not. A blow or a fisticuff will come within the meaning of &#39;causing bodily pain&#39; and hence, will be covered under this section.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><h1 style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Diseases<span class="p">: A communication of disease from one person to another by way of contact would constitute hurt. However, the position is unclear with respect to transmission of sexual diseases from one person to another. As per </span>Raka v. Emperor, 1887<span class="p">, a prostitute who had sexual intercourse with a person and thereby communicated syphilis was held liable under section 269, IPC for spreading infection and not for causing hurt because the interval between the act and disease was too remote to attract section 319, IPC.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Infirmity<span class="p">: Infirmity denotes unhealthy state of body or mind and a state of temporary mental impairment or hysteria or terror would constitute infirmity within the meaning of this expression in the section. (</span>See Jashanmal v Brahmanand, 1944<span class="p">) It is an inability of an organ to perform its normal function, whether temporarily or permanently. (</span>See Anis v.

(<b>Beshor Bewa,1872</b>) Where in course of a sudden quarrel the accused hit his friend on his head with a stick</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">weighing only 210 grams which unfortunately proved fatal, it was held that no knowledge of death could be ascribed to him.

For instance, if a person beats another intending to do no more than cause him hurt and death ensues owing to an undisclosed disease, the accused would be liable for hurt caused and not death which was thereby occasioned<b>.( Hari Singh Gour, Penal Law of India, Vol III, 11th Edition, 2009, Law Publishers, Allahabad, p. 3221</b>). Intention is the decisive factor under this section.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In <b>Pichapillai v. State of Tamil Nadu</b>, the Madras High Court altered the conviction of the accused from section 304(II) to section 323, IPC observing that there was no intention of the accused to kill the deceased, where the accused pushed the deceased on the chest due to which deceased fell down on a stone which resulted in his death.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">As per Section 323, Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 334, voluntarily causes hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Exception to Rule</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">If a person voluntarily causes hurt on grave and sudden provocation, if he neither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause hurt he will be punished as per Section 334 with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one month, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Grevious Hurt:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The draftsman of IPC found it difficult to draw a line between those bodily hurts, which are serious, and those which are slight. However, they designated certain kinds of hurts as grievous hurt:</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Section 320, IPC only designates following kinds of hurt as grievous:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First <span class="p">— Emasculation;</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 197%;text-align: left;">Secondly <span class="p">—Permanent privation of the sight of either eye; </span>Thirdly <span class="p">— Permanent privation of the hearing of either ear; </span>Fourthly <span class="p">— Privation of any member or joint;</span></h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Fifthly <span class="p">— Destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or joint;</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sixthly <span class="p">— Permanent disfiguration of the head or face;</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seventhly <span class="p">—Fracture or dislocation of a bone or tooth;</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Eighthly <span class="p">—Any hurt which endangers life or which causes the sufferer to be during the space of twenty days in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits.</span></h1><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Emasculation:<span class="h1"> </span><span class="p">The first kind of grievous hurt is depriving a person of his virility. This clause is confined to males only and was inserted to counteract the practice common in India for women to squeeze men’s testicles on the slightest provocation. Emasculation may be caused by inflicting such injury to the scrotum of a man as has the effect of rendering him impotent. The impotency caused must be permanent, and not merely temporary and curable.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Injuring Eyesight<span class="p">: Another injury of equal gravity is the permanent privation of the sight of either eye. Such injury must have the effect of permanently depriving the injured of the use of one or both of his eyes. The test of gravity is the permanency of the injury because it deprives a person of the use of his sight and also disfigures him.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Causing Deafness<span class="p">: The permanent privation of hearing of either ear is lesser serious than the above-mentioned injury as it does not disfigure a person, but only deprives him of the use of his ear. However, it is a serious injury to deprive a person of his sense of hearing. The deafness must be permanent to attract this provision. Such an injury may be caused by blow given on head, ear or those parts of head which communicate with and injure the auditory nerves or by thrusting a stick into the ear or putting into ear a substance which causes deafness.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Loss of Limb:<span class="h1"> </span><span class="p">Permanent privation of any member or joint is another grievous hurt, whereby a person is rendered less able to defend himself or to annoy his adversary. (S.K.Sarvaria, R.A.Nelson’s Indian Penal Code, Vol. 3, 9th Edition, LexisNexis, New Delhi, p.3310) ‘Member’ means nothing more than an organ or a limb. ‘Joint’ refers to a place where two or more bones or muscles join. Their permanent privation must involve such injury to them as makes them permanently stiff, so that they are unable to perform the normal function assigned to themin human physiology.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Impairing of Limb:<span class="h1"> </span><span class="p">The deprivation of a person to the use of member or joint involves lifelong crippling and makes a person defenceless and miserable. The provision speaks of destruction or permanent impairing of their powers, which would include not only total but also a particular use of the limb or joint. Any permanent decrease in their utility would constitute grievous hurt.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Permanent Disfiguration of the Head or Face:<span class="h1"> </span><span class="p">‘Disfigure’ means to do a person some external injury which detracts from his personal appearance, but does not weaken him. Branding a girls cheek with a red hot iron, if leaves permanent scars, amounts to disfiguration. A cut on the bridge of the nose of a girl caused by a sharp weapon has been held to be permanent disfigurement even though the internal wall was intact.( Kedarmal v.

The expression ‘<b>endangers life</b>’ is much stronger than the expression ‘dangerous to life’. Sections 326, 329 331, 333, 335 and 338 prescribe punishment for causing grievous hurt under various other circumstances.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Voluntarily causing grievous hurt</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">As per section 322, “Whoever <b>voluntarily causes hurt</b>, if the hurt which <b>he intends to cause or knows himself </b>to be <b>likely to cause is grievous hurt</b>, and if the hurt which he causes is grievous hurt, is said &quot;voluntarily to cause grievous hurt&quot;.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Explanation <span class="p">- A person is not said voluntarily to cause grievous hurt except when he both causes grievous hurt and intends or knows himself to be likely to cause grievous hurt.

That would determine whether in the case section 325 or section 326 would be applicable. Considering the size of the stone which was used, as revealed by material on record, it cannot be said that a dangerous weapon was used. Therefore, the conviction was altered to section 325 IPC, 1860.(<b>See Mathai vs State of Kerela,2005</b>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Where a player in a friendly cricket match blew a stump against another player which hit his head and caused death, it was held that the intention to cause death or likelihood of it being not proved, an offence under section 325 was made out, injury having been caused by a blunt weapon. (<b>Mohinder Singh 1985 Case</b>)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">During the pendency of proceedings under these sections, the parties effected a compromise at the instance of their elders. Parties belonged to the same family and there was no previous enmity. Permission to compound the offence under section 325 was granted by the High Court.
