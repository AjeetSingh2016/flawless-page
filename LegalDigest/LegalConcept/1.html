      People may believe that if they plan to commit a crime, but do not
      actually go through with it, that they will not be held responsible for a
      crime. This belief is mistaken; however, as there are laws set out for specific offences called “inchoate” offences.
      Inchoate means that a criminal act was anticipated or prepared for, but
      not completed. The major offences which are included in this are:
      <b>Abetment </b>and Conspiracy.

      Aid may be given both by an act of commission as well as by an act of

      persons were likely to be tortured for the purposes of extorting
      confession keeps himself away from the place, he is liable for abetment to
      the offence of extortion by an act of omission. (see Faguna Kama Nath v.

      present when the act or the offence is being committed in consequence of

      The section covers all offences and is a general provision for abetment of
      any number of persons exceeding ten. When more than ten persons are
      instigated to commit an offence punishable with death, the offence comes
      under section 115 as well as this section.(see
      <b>Dwarkanath Goswami, (1932)</b>)
