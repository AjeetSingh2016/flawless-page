When the Britishers added chapter V-A, they had a colonial mindset /agenda but even today in independent India it is</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">relevant. Section 120A is a much broader and more comprehensive, also this section serves the purpose better than section 107.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>Ratanlal and Dheeraj lal, </b>The conspiracy is held to be continued and renewed as to all its <b>members wherever and whenever any member of the conspiracy </b>acts in furtherance of the common design. Offence of criminal conspiracy has its foundation in an agreement to commit an offence. A conspiracy consists not merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to do an unlawful act by unlawful means.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">A criminal conspiracy must be put to action inasmuch as so long a crime is generated in the mind of an accused, it does not become punishable. As per <b>State of MP v Sheetla Sahai, 2009 </b>What is necessary is not thoughts, <b>which may even be criminal in character</b>, often involuntary, but offence would be said to have been committed thereunder only when that take concrete shape of an agreement to do or cause to be done an illegal act or an act which <b>although not illegal by illegal means and then if nothing further is done the agreement would give rise to a criminal conspiracy.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ingredients of this offence are<span class="p">: Section 120 -A</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l3"><li data-list-text="(1)"><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">that there must be an agreement between the persons who are alleged to conspire; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(2)"><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">that the agreement should be</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l4"><li data-list-text="(i)"><h1 style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">for doing of an illegal act<span class="p">, or</span></h1></li><li data-list-text="(ii)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As pe <b>Yogesh v State of Maharashtra, 2008 </b>for doing by illegal means an act which may not itself be illegal.

For the offence of conspiracy some kind of physical manifestation of agreement is required to be established the essence of criminal conspiracy</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">is agreement between two or more persons The evidence as to the transmission of thoughts sharing the unlawful act is not sufficient.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per (<b>Pratapbhai Hamirbhai Solanki v State of Gujarat, 2013</b>) A conspiracy is a continuing offence which continues to subsist till it is executed or rescinded or frustrated by choice of necessity. During its subsistence whenever any one of the conspirators does an act or series of acts, he would be held guilty under section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Actus reus in Criminal Conspiracy</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The actus reus in a conspiracy is the agreement to execute the illegal conduct, not the execution of it. It is not enough that two or more persons pursued the same unlawful object at the same time or in the same place; it is <b>necessary to show a meeting of minds</b>, a consensus to give effect to an unlawful purpose. It is not, however, In case <b>Chaman Lal v State of Punjab, AIR 2009 necessary that each conspirator should have been in communication with every other</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overt act is necessary or not</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In a case <b>Sushil Suri v CBI, 2011 </b>where the agreement is for accomplishment of an act which by itself constitutes an offence, then in that event, unless the Statute so requires, no overt act is necessary to be proved by the prosecution because in such a fact-situation criminal conspiracy is established by proving such an agreement</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In case SC <b>Bahri v State of Bihar,1994 </b>Where the conspiracy alleged is with regard to the commission of a serious crime as contemplated by section 120-B read with the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 120A, then the mere proof of an agreement is enough to bring about conviction under section 120B and the proof of any overt act by the accused or by any of them would not be necessary.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is manifest that the <b>meeting of minds of two or more persons is a sine qua non </b>but it may not be possible to establish by direct evidence. Its existence and objective can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances and parties conduct. It is necessary that the <b>incriminating circumstances must form a chain of events</b>, from which a conclusion about the accused&#39;s guilt could be drawn. The help of <b>circumstantial evidence is necessary because a conspiracy is always hatched in secrecy. </b>It becomes difficult to locate any direct evidence <b>in Yogesh v State of Maharashtra, 2008.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sections 34, 107 and 120-A</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">There is not much substantial difference While in the <b>120A, the gist of the offence is bare engagement and association to break the law </b>even though the illegal act does not follow. the gist of the offence under <b>section 34 is the commission of a criminal act in furtherance of a common intention of all the offenders</b>, which means that there should be unity of criminal behaviour resulting in something, for which an individual would be punishable, if it were all done by himself alone. But, for an offence under the <b>second clause of section 107 an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy and a mere agreement is not enough.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Punishment for the criminal conspiracy</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Criminal conspiracy is an independent offence. It is punishable separately. For purposes of punishment, Section 120B divides criminal conspiracies into two classes. A <b>party to a conspiracy to commit a serious offence, (ie an offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or with a more severe punishment)</b>, is, in the absence of express provision in the IPC, <b>punished in the same manner as if he had abetted the offence</b>. Conspiracies to commit any other offence (including offences punishable only with fine) and conspiracies to commit illegal acts other than offences are subjected to a uniform punishment, namely, imprisonment for a term up to six months with or without fine or both.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per Section 120-B(1), Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence <b>punishable with death, [imprisonment for life] or rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards</b>, shall, where no express provision is made in this Code for the punishment of such a conspiracy, be punished in the same manner as if he had abetted such offence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">And clause 2, Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy other than a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable as aforesaid shall be punished with imprisonment of either <b>description for a term not exceeding six months</b>, or with fine or with both.</p></body></html>
