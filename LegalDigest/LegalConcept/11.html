      The term ‘extradition’ originates from two Latin words- ‘ex‘ meaning ‘out’
      and ‘tradium‘ meaning ‘give up’. It is based on the Latin legal maxim “<b
        >aut dedere autjudicare</b
      >” meaning “<b>either extradite or prosecute</b>”. It is an ancient mechanism, dating
      back to at least the 13th century BC, when an Egyptian pharaoh, Ramesses
      II, negotiated an extradition treaty with a Hittite king, Hattusili III.

      When <b>no applicable extradition agreement </b>is in place, a sovereign
      may still request the expulsion or lawful return of an individual pursuant
      to the requested state&#39;s domestic law. This can be accomplished
      through the immigration laws of the requested state or other facets of the
      requested state&#39;s domestic law. <br><br> Similarly, the codes of penal
      procedure in many countries contain provisions allowing for extradition to
      take place in the absence of an extradition agreement. Sovereigns may, therefore, still request the

      state in the absence of an extradition treaty.

      The concept of extradition is based on the contention that an accused or
      convict can be tried or punished with utmost efficacy at the place where
      the cause of action arose or the crime took place. This is because it is
      much more advantageous to prosecute the offender in the country where he
      committed the offence; for instance, procuring the relevant evidence is
      more convenient in the country where the offence was committed than in any
      other country. Also, such a country has a significant amount of interest
      in punishing the offender.

      Moreover, the concept of state sovereignty kicks in while dealing with
      extradition. State sovereignty refers to the ultimate authority of the
      concerned state over its own citizens and territorial jurisdiction. So,
      technically speaking, no state is required or bound to hand over to
      another state any person (either its own citizen or a non-citizen)
      currently present within its territorial jurisdiction.

      However, the mutual interests of both the territorial state and the
      requesting state for the maintenance of law and order and the
      administration of justice require that the nations should cooperate with
      each other in returning the accused person or convict to the requesting
      state. Hence, to avoid the clash between state sovereignty and
      administration of justice, most states enter into various treaties
      governing extradition. Also, various countries incorporate provisions for
      extradition in their penal codes.

          Principal of Reciprocity<span class="p"
            >: The principle of reciprocity is well-founded under various
            aspects of international law. It provides that every act of favour,
            respect, benefit or penalty that a country bestows on the citizens
            or legal entities of another country, should be returned
            (reciprocated) in the same manner. It provides for the mutual
            expression of international support. As far as extradition is
            concerned, the principle of reciprocity applies that the territorial
            state must extradite the accused persons or convicts in exchange for
            any diplomatic kindness shown by the requesting state. Such
            diplomatic kindness may be any act, ranging from tariff relaxations
            or enforcement of foreign judgments to military or economic aid.
            This principle may also operate for the mutual extradition of
            accused persons or convicts of the respective countries.</span

            Meaning, the fugitive’s activity must constitute a crime in both the territorial
            state and the requesting state. For instance, if an individual is convicted of
            ‘perjury’ under English Law, but his acts do not constitute ‘perjury’
            under American Law, then America can reject the request by England to

      In India, the extradition of a fugitive from India to a foreign country or
      vice versa is covered by the provisions of the
      <b>Extradition Act, 1962 </b>which forms the extant legislative basis for
      this area of law. The act lays down the first principles of extradition
      law. The obligation to extradite springs out of
      treaties/arrangements/conventions entered into by India with other
      countries. Under <b>Section 3 of the Extradition Act</b>, a notification
      can be issued by the Government of India extending the provisions of the
      Act to the countries notified.

      Considerations To Be Kept In Mind By The Central Government While Deciding
      Question Of Surrender/Extradition And Restrictions On Exercise Of Such
      Power.The theory of territorial sovereignty is a well-established
      principle. A country can exercise its sovereignty only in its territory.

      nation. That is where the principles of granting asylum and extradition

      Extradition is the process in which an accused or convict who has escaped
      from the territory of prosecuting nation to a foreign state is brought to
      the former. To extradite an accused or convict from a foreign nation, a
      formal request has to be filed.

      Usually nations extradite accused or convicts between them either based on

      country or the treaty entered into by them.

      The Geneva Convention and their Additional Protocols (1949) were some of
      the earliest conventions that dealt with extradition to some extent; it
      recognised the state’s cooperation in extradition. Thereafter, most
      countries have signed several multilateral and bilateral treaties on
      extradition. For instance, the United States of America has signed
      extradition treaties with over 100 countries. Various countries have also
      incorporated provisions for extradition in their penal codes.

      government of England rejected the extradition request of Switzerland. The
      court held that the accused murdered in order to cause political
      disturbance, which constitutes a crime of political nature. Hence, England
      was not obliged to extradite him.

        Punjab National Bank (PNB) filed a complaint before the Central Bureau
        of Investigation (</a
      >CBI), alleging Nirav, along with his wife Mrs Ami Modi, of fraudulently
      obtaining fake Letters of Understanding (LoU) worth ₹11,400 crores. The
      money was then channelised to his fifteen overseas sham companies.
      Following a CBI probe, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) confiscated
      Nirav’s assets in India. He fled India and sought asylum in the United
      Kingdom. Interpol issued a Red Corner Notice against him in 2018.
      Following an extradition request from India, a Westminster Court issued an
      arrest warrant against Nirav. The Court ordered his extradition to India
      in 2021.
