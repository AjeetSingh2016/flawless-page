      The phenomenon of the breaking up of the marital tie between the two
      spouses is known as dissolution of Marriage. After the dissolution of
      marriage, the two spouses get separated and are free to marry any third
      person of their choice. Islamic law has recognised and regularized the
      institution of dissolution of marriage. Islam discourages divorce in
      principle and permits
      <b
        >it only when it becomes absolutely impossible for the parties to live
        in peace and harmony</b
      >.

                              Talaq-e-Ahsan is a single pronouncement in the
                              period of Tuhr, (that is, purity, when the woman
                              is free from her menstrual courses), followed by
                              abstinence from sexual intercourse during that
                              period of purity as well as during the whole
                              period of Iddat. The requirement of purity is not
                              applicable when the wife has passed the age of
                              menstruation, or the parties have been away from
                              each other for a long time or when the marriage
                              has not been consummated. The advantage of this
                              form of talaq is that it can be revoked at any
                              time before the completion of the period of Iddat
                              and thus hasty and thoughtless divorces can be
                              prevented.

                              menstruation, then the pronouncement of talaq may
                              be made after the interval of 30 days between the
                              successive pronouncements. When the third
                              pronouncement is made, the talaq becomes final and
                              irrevocable.

              The term ‘Ila’ literally means ‘oath’ or ‘vow’. According to Abdur
              Rahim Principles of Mohammedan Jurisprudence (Pg. 338), in some
              cases the conduct of the husband will have the effect of
              repudiation, though he did not use the word Talaq or any other
              expression with the intention of dissolving the marriage. This is
              when he swears that he will have nothing to do with his wife and
              in pursuance of such oath abstains from her society for four
              months. This form of divorce is known as Ila.

              The husband may revoke the oath by resumption of marital life.
              After the expiry of four months, in Hanafi law the marriage is
              dissolved without legal process. The Shafis and the Shias hold
              that this does not result in Talaq, but merely gives the wife the
              right of judicial divorce.

      The term ‘Zihar’ is derived from ‘Zuhar’ the back. This is an inchoate
      divorce. In this form the husband swears that to him the wife is like the
      back of his mother, or sister, or any other woman within the degrees of
      prohibited relationship. If he intends to revoke this declaration, he has
      to pay money by way of expiation or fast for a certain period. After the
      oath has been taken the wife has the right to go to the court and obtain
      divorce or restitution of conjugal rights on expiation.

      The husband in Muslim law has the power to delegate his own right of
      pronouncing Talaq to some third person or to the wife herself. The person
      to whom the power is thus delegated may then pronounce the divorce
      accordingly. Such a delegation of power is called ‘tafwid’. The husband
      may delegate the power absolutely or conditionally, temporarily or
      permanently. A permanent delegation of power is revocable but a temporary
      delegation of power is not. The delegation must be made distinctly in
      favour of the person to whom the power is delegated and the purpose of
      delegation must be clearly stated.

      A stipulation that, under certain specified conditions, the wife can
      pronounce divorce upon herself has been held to be valid, provided first,
      that the option is not absolute and unconditional and secondly, that the
      conditions are reasonable and not opposed to public policy. This doctrine
      of delegated divorce is peculiar to the Muslim Law, and has no parallel in
      other systems. Fyzee says: ‘This form of delegated divorce is perhaps the
      most potent weapon in the hands of a Muslim wife to obtain her freedom
      without the intervention of any court and is now beginning to be fairly
      common in India.’

          The word Khula literally means to put off. In law it is lying down by
          a husband of his right and authority over his wife for an exchange.
          Khula has the authority of Quran (2:229). The leading case on Khula is
          Moonshe Bazul Raheem v. Luteef-ut-oon-Nissa, (1861) 8. MIM, 879) where
          their lordships of the Privy Council observed: “A divorce by Khula is
          a divorce with the consent, and at the instance of the wife, in which
          she gives or agrees to give a consideration to the husband for her
          release from the marriage tie. In such a case, the terms of the
          bargain are a matter of arrangement between the husband and the wife,
          may: as the consideration release her dower and other rights, or make
          any other agreement for the benefit of the husband”.

      The word ‘mubara’ denotes the act of freeing each other by mutual consent.
      In the words of Fyzee, “in the case of Khula, the wife begs to be released
      and the husband agrees for a certain consideration, which is usually a
      part or whole of the dower; while in mubara’a apparently both are happy at
      the prospect of getting rid of each other”. The offer in a mubara’a
      divorce  may proceed from the wife, or it may proceed from the husband but once it
      is accepted, the dissolution is complete and it operates as a single
      irrevocable divorce.

      Among the Sunnis when the parties to marriage enter into mubara’a, all
      mutual rights and obligations come to an end. The Shia law is stringent.
      It requires that both the parties must find the marital relationship to be
      irksome in a bonafide manner. The main distinction between a Khula and
      mubara’a is that in the former the aversion is on the side of the wife and
      she desires a separation but in the later the aversion is mutual and both
      sides desire separation.

      Secondly, in a divorce by Khula some consideration must be given by the
      wife to the husband for her release from the marital tie. It is in effect
      an offer from the wife for her release on payment of a compensation. On
      the other hand, in a divorce by mubara’a no compensation is given by the
      wife to the husband for her release from the marital tie because both are
      happy at the prospect of getting rid of each other.

      Lian means a testimony confirmed by oath and accompanied with imprecation.
      Divorce by mutual imprecation is mentioned in the Quran and is supported
      by the traditions of the Prophet (SAW). The law of Islam punishes the
      offenses of adultery (Zina) severely and so it takes serious view of an
      imputation of unchastity against a married woman. It is reported that a
      man from the Ansar accused his wife of adultery.

      The Prophet (SAW) thereupon asked them both to take an oath. Then he
      ordered them to be separated from each other. If a husband accused his
      wife of infidelity, he was liable to punishment for defaming his wife
      unless he proved his allegation. If there was no proof forthcoming, the
      procedure of lian was adopted. A husband accuses his wife of adultery, but
      is unable to prove the allegation. The wife in such a case is entitled to
      sue for the dissolution of the marriage.

            coupled with an imprecation in these terms “The wrath of God be upon

          The word ‘<b>faskh’ means annulment or abrogation</b>. It comes from a
          root, which means ‘to annul or to rescind’. Hence it refers to the
          power of the
          <b>Muslim Qazi to annul a marriage on the application of the wife. </b
          >It may be defined as the dissolution or rescission of the contract of
          marriage by judicial decree. The law of faskh is founded upon the
          Quranic injunctions and the traditions of the Prophet (SAW). The
          Quranic verse runs thus: “<b
            >If ye fear a breach between the husband and the wife, send a judge
            out of his and another from her family; if they are desirous of
            agreement. God will effect a reconciliation between them; for God is
            knowing and appraised of all”. (Quran 6:35)</b
