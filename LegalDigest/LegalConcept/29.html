It is a phrase in Latin which means ‘a thing decided’. This term itself very clear which means that Res is dispute and Judicata is adjudicated and this term collectively means that the dispute decided or has been adjudicated. This term is also known as <b>Rule of Conclusiveness.</b></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It was a way to ensure that a similar case cannot be taken up again either in distinctive or in equivalent Court of India. This is simply to make sure that a common offended party may not recuperate harms from the respondent twice for similar damage.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The doctrine of res judicata has been explained by <b>Das Gupta, J </b>in the case of <b>Satyadhyan Ghosal v. Deorjin Debi</b></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">“The principle of res judicata is based on the need of giving finality to judicial decisions. What it says is that once a res is judicata. It shall not be adjudged again. Preliminary it applies as between past litigation and future litigation. when a matter whether on a question of fact or a question of a decision is final, either because no appeal was taken on higher court or because the appeal was dismissed, or no appeals lies, neither party will lie, neither part will be allowed in future suit bar proceeding between the same parties to canvass the matter again.”</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The doctrine of res sub-judice is given under <b>section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code</b>. In Latin sub judice means <b>‘under judgement’</b>. The doctrine of res sub-judice is to restrict a plaintiff to one litigation and to preclude the possibility of two contradictory judgments by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">one and the same court in respect of the same relief.(<b>See Bal Kishan v. Kishan Lal (1889)) </b>The objective is to preclude the trial of parallel cases between the same parties simultaneously in the courts of concurrent jurisdiction and to avoid the conflicting decisions of two competent courts over the same matter and also to save the time of the court.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In the Language of Bare Act, <b>Section 11. Res judicata </b>- <i>No Court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a Court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such Court.’</i></p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Res sub judice <span class="p">is a Latin maxim which cannot be found in the code of civil procedure. Res sub judice refers to a matter pending trial and operates as a bar to a trial of a suit which is pending decision in a previously instituted suit. The doctrine therefore bars a trial on some conditions but doesn’t prevent the filing of a new suit. </span>A similar rule is contained in section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 10. Stay of Suit <span class="s2">- No Court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which the matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title where such suit is pending in the same or any other Court in India having jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed, or in any court in India established or continued by the Central Government and having like jurisdiction, or before the Supreme Court.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Note <span class="p">- Thus, the doctrine’s use is to prevent the trial of two parallel suits on the same issue</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in different courts to avoid different conflicting decisions.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The doctrine is based on three Roman maxims: -</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Nemo debet lis vaxari pro eaderm causa <b>(no man should be vexed twice for the same cause).</b></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Interest republicae ut sit finis litium <b>(it is in the interest of the state that there should be an end to a litigation).</b></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Re judicata pro veritate occipitur <b>(a judicial decision must be accepted as correct)</b></p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><u>Note</u> <span class="p">- Res judicata was identified in Hindu Law as </span>‘Purva Nyaya’ <span class="p">(</span>former judgement<span class="p">.)

For instance, when the previous decision of the court was clearly wrong. Nonetheless, its applicability was legitimized, as the rule says there must be an end to each litigation. The premise of the principle of res judicata is open intrigue and not absolute justice. In case of a wrong</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">decision, “the suffering citizen must appeal to the law-giver and not to the lawyers”.(See</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sheoparsan Singh v Ramnandan Singh, 1916<span class="p">).</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conditions of Res Judicata</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Several conditions must be fulfilled to constitute res judicata:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">There must be two suits between same parties or their representative.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">They should prosecute under a same title.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The matter directly and substantially in issue in both the suits must be related Or, the matter directly and substantially in issue in the ensuing suit should also be directly and substantially in issue in the previous suit.</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">.

The Hon&#39;ble Supreme Court of India has given the landmark judgement in <b>State of Uttar Pradesh v. Nawab Hussian, (1977) </b>, a direct question arose before the Hon&#39;ble Supreme Court whereby in this case A Sub-Inspector of Police was dismissed from the service by the DIG (Director General of Police). He challenged the order of his dismissal in High Court in a Writ Petition saying that he was not given reasonable opportunity of being heard by the authorities and later he took the additional grounds that he was appointed by IGP <b>(Inspector General of Police) </b>and he was removed by the DIG (Director General of Police).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The latter has no power to dismiss him. The State contended that the additional ground taken by him is Res-Judicata. The State High Court allowed the petition of Sub-Inspector of Police. But State of U.P. has filed a appeal in Supreme Court of India whereby Hon&#39;ble Bench of Court said that suit Sub-Inspector of Police was barred by Constructive Res-Judicata as court said that the plea was within the knowledge of plaintiff and could be taken earlier.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><u><b>Res-Judicata in Writ Petitions </b></u>- Though Res-Judicata does not applied in writ petitions but there is no right ground to prevent the decisions in the matters in writ proceedings under Article-32 or Article-226 of Indian Constitution from operating as Res-Judicata in the subsequent proceedings.
