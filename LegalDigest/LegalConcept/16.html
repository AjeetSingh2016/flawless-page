        >Judicial Separation is a medium under the law to give some time for
        self-analysis to both the parties of a disturbed married life. Law gives
        a chance to both the husband and wife to rethink about the extension of

        separately. By doing this, the law allows them the free space and
        independence to think about their future path and it is the last option
