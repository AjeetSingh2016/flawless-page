It makes any deliberate act perpetrated by persons of one religious persuasion for the insult or annoyance of persons of another persuasion punishable.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This chapter of the IPC seems to be in tune with the constitutional ethos of India. India being a secular state, the Indian Constitution accords equal protection to all religions. <b>Article 25 of the Constitution </b>guarantees the right to freedom of religion. All persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to propagate, practice and profess the religion of their choice. However, the freedom of religion is not an unlimited one. It is subject to public order, morality and health. However, at the same time, the state has to ensure that the religious beliefs of individuals do not become a matter of hostilities, controversies and violence among people. Chapter XV of the IPC ostensibly helps the state in maintaining religious harmony in the country.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The chapter contains five sections--ss 295, 295A, 296, 297 and 298. The offences under this chapter can be broadly classified into the following three divisions:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Defilement of places of worship or objects of veneration <b>(Section 295 and section 297)</b></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Outraging and Wounding the feelings of the persons <b>(Section 295A and 298)</b></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Disturbing Religious Assemblies <b>(section 296)</b></p></li></ol><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Defilement of Places of Worship:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Section 295.

It compels people to respect the religious sus-ceptibilities of persons of different religious persuasion or creeds.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">While s 297 extends the principle of Section 295 to places which are treated as sacred.

It is very important that the person has the intention to destroy, damage or defile a place of worship or an object (declared as a holy object by any religion). Without any malafide intention to hurt religious feelings, a person cannot be held liable under Section 295. Mere defilement of a place of worship is not offensive under these Sections. The intention to insult is assessed by the facts and circumstances of the case.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">“A” belongs to Mohammedan religion and he throws a lit cigarette on the Viman (a holy object of Hindu religion), it cannot be claimed to be an unintentional act. Such action will be offensive under IPC. Sexual intercourse inside a mosque or a temple is an offence under Section 297 of the IPC.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Destruction, Damage and Defilement <span class="p">- These words should be understood in the sense of making property dirty, unclean or foul. It does not mean only physically or materially damaging the property but it is also something, that would affect the pure state of the place. The word ‘defilement’ does not mean only physical destruction but also situations where a place of worship or holy object of worship coated ritually or in an impure manner.</span></h1></li><li data-list-text="3."><h1 style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Place or Object to be Sacred <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1956600/" class="s3" target="_blank">- It is an essential ingredient of this Section that the destruction caused must be of a place of worship or holy place. As a general rule, temples, churches, mosques, synagogues, kyaungs are considered holy places by virtue of them being places of worship. In the case of Joseph v. State </a><span class="p">of Kerala, a hut was used as a worship place by people of a specific religion. ‘A’ took possession by court order and took down the images of the Hindu Gods and was charged under Section 295. The High Court held that ‘A’ has the right to do whatever he has done and he had not intended to hurt the religious beliefs and holy object and hence, he was held not guilty.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Object not includes Animals</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The word &#39;object&#39; does not include animate objects. It refers only to inanimate objects such as churches, mosques, temples, and marble or stone figures representing gods. Killing of a cow by a Mohammedan, within the sight of a public road frequented by Hindus, is not punishable under this Section. Similarly, where a bull dedicated and set at large on a ceremonial occasion of Hindus in accordance with a religious usage was killed by certain Mohammedans secretly and at night in the presence of none but Mohammedans; it was held that no offence was committed. (<b>See Romesh Chunder Sannyal v Hiru Mondal</b>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="4."><h1 style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Tresspass into a place of worship or a place of Sepulture <span class="p">- According to Section 297, a person is liable when he trespasses (not need to criminal trespass) into a place of worship or of sepulture. The word ‘trespass’ in this Section means an unjustifiable intrusion upon a property that is in the control of another. Sexual intercourse within a place of worship would make liable under this Section.</span></h1></li><li data-list-text="5."><h1 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Indignity to corpse (body) and Disturbing and Defaming funeral Rites <span class="p">- Any type of contempt to a human corpse disturbing the performance of funeral rites is a criminal offence under Section 297. ‘</span>Disturbance<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1772662/" class="s3" target="_blank">’ means any type of active intrusion to the funeral ceremonies.

After that, he came with police on cremation grounds and disturbed the ceremonies. But, it was found that the death of A’s mother had occurred naturally. ‘A’ filed a complaint against accused under Section 297. The accused was held guilty and was sentenced to three months of rigorous imprisonment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">What is indignity to corpse is not defined anywhere. Indignity is generally synonymous to humiliation or disgrace. A conduct to be criminal in the sense of section 297, IPC, 1860 should be spiteful to become humiliating or disgraceful. In a particular situation, an act may not cause disgrace or may not humiliate, but, in other situations that very act may cause disgrace or humiliation. So the intentions of the person concerned as well as surrounding circumstances are important factors (<b>See Surdarshan Kumar v Gangacharan Dubey, 1999</b>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Outraging and Wounding the feelings of the persons (Section 295A and 298)</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 295A deals with ‘<b>Intentional and spiteful activities</b>, intended to outrage religious beliefs of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs’.

In India, it is lawful for any religion to use public streets and play music as a part of their religious procession. The only condition is, that they should not interfere with the ordinary use of that particular street in which they are moving. However, playing music intentionally by any such religious procession in front of a mosque where prayers are being offered, whether it should be treated as an offence under Section 296 of IPC is a difficult situation to prove.
