Hence, the <b>&quot;wilful conduct&quot; or the &quot;harassment” </b>(Heeralal vs State of Rajasthan,2017) coming under clauses (a) and (b) may or may not be related to dowry.

Again, section 2 (2) of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 defines &quot;dowry&quot; in similar terms as &quot;<b>any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly</b>&quot; but it says that it should be agreed to be given &quot;<b>as consideration for the marriage</b>&quot; and the latter link is missing in section 498A.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><u>Note:</u> <span class="p">‘All the circumstances’ phrase employed under Section 113A of Evidence Act includes Suicide Notes and dying Declaration (</span>See Ramesh Kumar v Chhattisgarh, 2001<span class="p">)</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">(<b>In Jagdish Chander vs state of Haryana, 1988</b><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/294349/" class="a" target="_blank">), it was held that the first requisite for raising the presumption under </a><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1953529/" class="a" target="_blank">Section 113A, Evidence Act is that it must be proved that wife was subjected to cruelty as defined in </a><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1569253/" class="a" target="_blank">Section 498A, </a>I.P.C. and that the fact of wilful conduct of the accused in taking the liquor almost daily despite constant protest by his wife and his habit of coming home late in the night did not fulfil the essential ingredients of the cruelty as given in Section 498A, IPC.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>State of West Bengal vs Orilal Jaiswal, 1994</b>…The presumption under section 113A is of &quot;may presume&quot; variety and hence not a mandatory presumption, and the presumption depends on the Court&#39;s assessment &quot;having regard to all the other circumstances of the case&quot;.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per Dr Nageshwar Rao “In assessing the evidence in rebuttal of the presumption, the Court must have &quot;regard to all the other circumstances of the case&quot; as required under section 498A as to whether the &quot;willful conduct&quot; of the husband &quot;is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">How much cruelty is too much is case-specific and depends on factors such as: (1) the kind of conduct; (2) length of the conduct; (3) the sensitive nature of the woman, and (4) their relative social background.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Position of Estoppel in Non Compoundable Offence</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In some cases, the Courts have held that the compromise arrived at by the parties was unlawful as the offence is non-compoundable under section 320 Cr PC and the parties could</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">not be estopped from going back on the compromise In some other decisions, the Supreme Court and High Courts have quashed the criminal proceedings &quot;to prevent abuse of the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice&quot; under section 482 of Cr PC 1973.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The question was ultimately referred to a larger Bench of the Supreme Court in <b>Gian Singh v Punjab, (2012)</b>, and the Supreme Court, upholding the decisions in BS Joshi, Nikhil Merchant and Manoj Sharma case to quash the criminal proceedings, held:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: center;">“<i>Quashing of offence or criminal proceedings on the ground of settlement between an offender and victim is not the same thing as compounding of offence.
