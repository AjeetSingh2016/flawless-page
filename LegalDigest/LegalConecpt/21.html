Hence, you have to consider the <b>degree of intention of offenders</b>. If the person is killed in cold-blood or with well-planned then it is murder because the intention to kill is in high degree. On other hand, person is killed <b>without pre-planned</b>, in sudden fight or in sudden anger because of somebody’s provocation or instigation, then such death is called the <b>culpable homicide</b>.

The word <b>&quot;likely&quot; in clause (b) of section 299 conveys the sense of &#39;probable&#39; </b>as distinguished from a mere possibility. The words &#39;bodily injury... sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause &#39;death&#39; mean that death will be the most probable result of the injury, having regard to the ordinary course of nature.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Judicial Pronouncements</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Jayaraj v.

There was no evidence that <b>the accused intended to cause death or cause such bodily injury </b>as was sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death. It was held that the case fell within clause (b) of Section 299 but did not fall within clause 3 of Section 300, and as such his conviction under Section 302 was set aside and he was convicted under Section 304, Part I.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Randhir Singh v.

However, by reading the provisions, it can be analyzed that murder is nothing but the aggravated form of culpable homicide and is graver due to the higher probability of death in the case of murder. Further, <b>murder has not been defined in IPC</b>, what is mentioned in Section 300 of IPC is the <b>condition when culpable homicide would amount to murder</b>. Hence, murder is just a form of Culpable Homicide. Section 300 of IPC discusses the circumstances under which a culpable homicide would amount to murder and the exceptions to the same sections lays down certain conditions, when the culpable homicide would not amount to murder. Since there is no radical difference between the two offences except the degree of intention and knowledge (being higher in case of murder), a common line of distinction cannot be drawn. Hence, it will depend from case to case. As noted above, it’s the judge who plays the most crucial role in such cases.</p></body></html>
