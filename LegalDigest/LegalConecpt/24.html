In England the age of majority <b>formerly was 21 years</b>. But now under the <b>Family Law Reform Act, 1969</b>, &quot;<b>a minor is a person under the age of eighteen years&quot;</b>. Formerly a minor was referred to as an &quot;infant&quot;, but this Act has changed the term to &quot;minor&quot;.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natures of Minor agreement</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 10 requires that the parties to a contract must be competent and Section 11 declares that a <b>minor is not competent</b>. But neither section makes it clear whether, if a <b>minor enters into an agreement, it would be voidable at his option or altogether void</b>. These provisions had, therefore, quite naturally given rise to a controversy about the nature of a minor&#39;s agreement.&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As you can see prerequisite of contract <b>party must be competent to enter into contract </b>and being major is one the grounds for the applicability of contract But we are living in the word where minor also play vital role in contracts but Act 1872 is silent on this point.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The controversy was only resolved in 1903 by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in their well-known pronouncement in <b>Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose , 1903</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Facts of the case <span class="p">– the plaintiff Dharmodas Ghosh, when he was a minor, mortgaged his property to the defendant, a moneylender. At that time, defendant’s attorney had the</span></h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">knowledge about plaintiff’s age. The plaintiff later paid only Rs 8000 but refused to pay rest of the money. The plaintiff’s mother was his next friend (legal guardian) at that time, so he commenced an action against the defendant saying that at the time of making of a contract, he was a minor, so the contract being a void one, he is not bound by the same.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Sir Lord North observed<span class="p">: &quot;Looking at Section 11 their Lordships are satisfied that the Act makes it essential that </span>all contracting parties should be competent to contract <span class="p">and expressly provides that a person who by reason of infancy is incompetent to contract cannot make a contract within the meaning of the Act. The question whether a contract is void or voidable presupposes the existence of a contract within the meaning of the Act, and cannot arise in the case of an infant or Minor.&quot;</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No estoppel against minor</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Estoppel is a legal rule of evidence under <b>section 115 of Indian evidence act 1872 </b>which prevents a party from alleging something <b>that contradicts what he previously stated</b>. The court held that the doctrine of estoppel does not apply to the case in which the person knows the real facts, before hand and here the <b>attorney of the defendant knew that the</b></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">plaintiff was a minor. Hence this rule does not apply<span class="p">. The reason is very simple. There can be </span>no estoppel against a statute<span class="p">. The policy of the law of contract is to protect persons below age from contractual liability and naturally, the doctrine of estoppel cannot be used to defeat that policy.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Restitution of benefit</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">According to <b>Section 64 of the Indian Contract Act</b>, when a person at whose option a contract is voidable rescinds it, the other party need not perform it. This applies to <b>contracts that are voidable, but a minor’s contract is void, </b>and therefore, he cannot be asked to refund the amount money to the moneylender.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">No liability arising out of either tort/contract</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">A minor&#39;s agreement is, of course, in principle devoid of all legal effects. &quot;A minor is in law incapable of giving consent, and, there being no consent, there could be no change in the character&quot; or status of the parties. In England it was laid down as early as 1665 in <b>Johnson v Pye </b>that &quot;an infant who obtains a loan of money by falsely representing his age cannot be made to repay the amount of the loan in the form of damages for deceit&quot;.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A minor is incapable of giving consent, and the nature of minor’s agreement is a nullity and</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cannot be enforced.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Exception to general rule</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">For providing protection to a minor, his agreement is void. But there are certain exceptions as well.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">When minor has performed his obligation<span class="p">: In a contract, a minor can be a promisee but not a promisor. So if the minor has performed his part of the promise, but the other party hasn’t the minor being in the position of a promisee he can enforce the contract.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;"><u><b>A contract entered into by guardian of minor for his benefit</b></u>: In that case, a minor can sue the other party when it does not perform its promise. In the case of <b>Great American Insurance v. Madan Lal </b>the guardian on the behalf of her son entered into an insurance contract in respect of fire for the minor’s property. When the property was damaged and minor asked for the compensation, the insurer denied it by saying that a contract with a minor is a void one. But later the court held that this contract was enforceable, and he is liable to pay compensation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;"><u><b>Necessities Supplied to the Minor</b></u>: If a person is incapable of entering into a contract is supplied by another person with necessities of life, the person who has supplied is entitled to get <b>reimbursement from the property of such incompetent person</b>, including a child as well. But if the minor has no property of his own, then he cannot be bound to reimburse the other person.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;"><u><b>Contract of apprenticeship</b></u>: Under the <b>Indian Apprentices Act, 1850</b>, a contract of apprentice entered by guardian on his behalf is binding on the minor.</p></body></html>
