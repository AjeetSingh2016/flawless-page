The terms <b>voluntarily (Sec. 39) </b>and <b>fraudulently (Sec. 17) </b>are defined with reference to intention and knowledge. Even though, there are specific offences that incorporate fault element like intention but the code nowhere defines intention. Intention being the gravest shade of mens rea, lacks a definite meaning under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 The judges define the term differently in different situations which tend to give different interpretations to the word.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intention</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">A person intends an action if he wants a particular consequence to ensue from his action, whether the consequence is very likely or unlikely. Intention is the purpose or design with which an act is done. This shade of mens rea is most difficult to prove as one cannot enter into the mind of the accused. It should be gathered from surrounding circumstances. As per <b>Jai prakash v. delhi administration, 1991</b>, “Intention is an invisible state of mind which has to be gathered from the circumstances such as nature of the weapon used, nature of injuries, the multiplicity of injuries, force with which the attack has been made.” Intention does not require any kind of premeditation and can occur to the individual before the crime or at the time when the act is done. Intention is relevant in determining the criminal liability. The criminal law concerns with the intention. Intention is an immediate act.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intention under Indian Penal Code, 1860</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">If in a case, examination of Section 299 of IPC has to be done, and intention to cause death or intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death is proved, the punishment falls under section 304 part I of IPC which is imprisonment for life or for a term which may extend to ten years. If knowledge is proved then the punishment falls under part</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">II of section 304 which is imprisonment for term which may extend to ten years. The reason behind discussing the punishment is to highlight the grave punishment in case the matter falls either under intention to cause death or intention to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. Hence, it is significant that intention is not left as a term which defies precise definition. Taking into consideration the offences that are provided under IPC, intention should be defined depending upon the context in which it is used under many individual offences.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International Jurisprudence on Intention</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 197%;text-align: left;">Australian Criminal Code 1995 consists of definition of the term Intention. Intention is defined under <b>section 5.2 of Australian Criminal Code</b>, 1995 as follows:</p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="(1)"><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">a person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct.</p></li><li data-list-text="(2)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">a person has intention with respect to a circumstance if he or she believes that it exists or will exist.</p></li><li data-list-text="(3)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">a person has intention with respect to a result if he or she means to bring it about or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events.”</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The motive is not a sufficient test to determine the criminal character of the act or otherwise. Motive is something which pushes a person to do a certain act. It is a reason which impels a person to do a particular act or to engage in a criminal conduct. The criminal law does not concern with good or bad motive which is very problematic.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is pertinent to say that it is practically impossible for an individual to form intention without having any motive (see <b>alan norrie, crime, reason and history-a critical introduction to criminal law, pp. 43.) </b>Pure motive does not relieve a person from the criminal liability and a bad motive does not go on to determine the guilt of the accused.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is even contended that the ulterior intent is the motive for example, when a thief commits theft, his immediate intent is to appropriate the money and his ulterior intent is to satisfy his hunger by buying food In <b>Jai Prakash v. Delhi Administration</b>, Intention was defined as “<b>conscious state in which mental faculties </b>are aroused into activities and summoned into action for the purpose of achieving the conceived end. It means shaping of one’s conduct so as to bring about a certain event.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>Gangadeen vs State Of M.P, 2021 </b>&quot;An awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstances; a state of mind in which a person has no substantial doubt about the existence of a fact. It is necessary to distinguish between producing a result intentionally and producing it knowingly.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Intention and knowledge commonly go together, for he who intends a result usually knows that it will follow, and he who knows the consequences of his act usually intends them. But there may be intention without knowledge, the consequence being desired but not foreknown as certain or even probable.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Conversely, there may be knowledge without intention, the consequence being foreknown as the inevitable concomitant of that which is desired, but being itself an object of repugnance rather than desire, and therefore not intended.&quot;</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/212245/" class="s2" target="_blank">In the case of </a>Hari Singh vs. Sukhbir Singh &amp; Others, (1988) <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/455468/" class="s2" target="_blank">&quot;Under </a><span class="p">Section 307 IPC what the Court has to see is, whether the act irrespective of its result, was done with</span></h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in that section.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The intention or knowledge of the accused must be such as is necessary to constitute murder. Without this ingredient being established, there can be no offence of <b>&#39;attempt to murder&#39;</b><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/455468/" class="s2" target="_blank">. Under </a>Section 307 IPC the intention precedes the act attributed to accused.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/455468/" class="s2" target="_blank">Therefore, the intention is to be gathered from all circumstances and not merely from the consequences that ensue.

Some relevant considerations are :</p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="(1)"><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">the nature of weapon used;</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(2)"><h1 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">the place where injuries were inflicted;</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(3)"><h1 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">the nature of the injury caused;</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="(4)"><h1 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">the opportunity available which the accused gets.</h1></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Court has to see is, whether the act irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in that Section.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The intention or knowledge of the accused must be such as is necessary to constitute murder. Therefore, the intention is to be gathered from all the circumstances, and not merely from the consequences that ensue. The nature of the weapon used, manner in which it is used, motive for the crime, severity of the blow, the part of the body where the injury is inflicted are some of the factors that may be taken into consideration to determine the intention.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Motive</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Motive is said to mean the reason behind an action. Motive can be an answer to question that why an individual formed the intent to commit a crime. A motive is &quot;that which incites to action; anything prompting or exciting to choose, or moving the will; reason; inducement; object.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Motive is the power which impels one to act for a definite result. Motive is seen as a psychological inquiry into the state of the mind of person. The ulterior object is also referred to as Motive. Motive is not the fundamental test to determine the criminal liability. Hence an act which is done with the intention will remain unlawful and will not be excused merely on the ground that it was done with good motive.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">According to Alan Norrie, it is impossible to formulate intention without motive . Motive is something which prompts a man to form an intention. (See <b>Basdev v. The State Of Pepsu (1956)) </b>For example; A wants to inherit property from his uncle as early as possible therefore kills his uncle. Here the motive is to inherit property</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Sanjeev v. State of Haryana </b>, it was held that to establish commission of murder by an accused, motive is not required to be proved. Motive is something which prompts a man to form an intention. It is only either intention or knowledge which has to be seen in respect of the offence of culpable homicide.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Motive and intention Distinguished</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Motive is the power which pushes and impels one to action for a definite result, whereas intention is the purpose or design with which an act is done. Motive is generally a psychological inquiry into the state of mind of a person whereas intention is manifested through the external conduct of the person. Motive is not considered an element of crime and is irrelevant in determining the liability whereas intention is relevant in determining the guilt of the person. The ulterior intent is called the motive for example, If A commits theft</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">owing to starvation, the wrongdoer had some ulterior object. He intends the attainment of the ulterior objet as he intended to commit theft. Here intent can be divided into 2 parts: firstly, the immediate intent i.e. the intention to commit theft; secondly, the ulterior intent which is to buy food. This ulterior intent is motive as mentioned aforesaid. The latter passes beyond the wrongful act but is the part of the total intent and the former lies within the wrongful act.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Illustration<span class="h1"> </span><span class="p">- If A commits murder of B with intention to cause death, he will be liable even if he had good motive. Motive is irrelevant to criminal responsibility but is relevant as evidence (in certain cases) and in sentencing.</span></p></body></html>
