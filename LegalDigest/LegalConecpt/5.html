There are two main reasons for inflicting the punishment. <b>One is the belief that it is both right and just that a person who has done wrong should suffer for it</b>; the other is the belief that <b>inflicting punishment on wrongdoers discourages other from doing wrong</b>. Capital punishment should be distinguished from extrajudicial executions carried out without due process of law. The term death penalty is sometimes used interchangeably with capital punishment, though imposition of the penalty is not always followed by execution (even when it is upheld on appeal), because of the possibility of commutation to life imprisonment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Historical Background of Capital Punishment</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">History of human civilization reveals that during no period of time capital punishment has been discarded as a mode of punishment. Capital punishment for murder, treason, arson, and rape was widely employed in ancient Greece under the <b>laws of Draco (fl. 7th century BCE), </b>though Plato argued that <b>it should be used only for the incorrigible</b>. The Romans also used it for a wide range of offenses, though citizens were exempted for a short time during the republic This finds support in the observation made by Sir Henry Marine who stated that &quot;Roman Republic did not abolish death sentence though its non-use was primarily directed by the practice of punishment or exile and the procedure of questions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Capital Punishment in India</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">A careful scrutiny of the debates in British India&#39;s Legislative Assembly reveals that no issue was raised about capital punishment in the Assembly until 1931, when one of the Members from Bihar, Shri Gaya Prasad Singh sought to introduce a Bill to abolish the punishment of death for the offences under the Indian Penal Code. However, the motion was negatived after the then Home Minister replied to the motion.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The Government&#39;s policy on capital punishment in British India prior to Independence was clearly stated twice in 1946 by the then Home Minister, Sir John Thorne, in the debates of the Legislative Assembly. &quot;The Government does not think it wise to abolish capital punishment for any type of crime for which that punishment is now provided&quot;.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">For offences where the death penalty was an option, <b>Section 367(5) of the CrPC 1898 </b>required courts to record reasons where the court decided not to impose a sentence of death:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: center;">“If the accused is convicted of an offence punishable with death, and the court sentences him to any punishment other than death, the court shall in its judgment state the reason why sentence of death was not passed.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">But this provision Repealed in the year 1955 by Parliament and courts did not need special reasons for why they were not imposing the death penalty in cases where it was a prescribed punishment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Code of Criminal Procedure was re-enacted in 1973 (‘CrPC’), and several changes were</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">made, notably to Section 354(3):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: center;">When the conviction is for an offence punishable with death or, in the alternative, with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of years, the judgment shall state the reasons for the sentence awarded, and, in the case of sentence of death, the special reasons for such sentence.</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: center;">This was a significant modification from the situation following the 1955 amendment (where terms of imprisonment and the death penalty were equal possibilities in a capital case), and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">a reversal of the position under the 1898 law (where death sentence was the norm and reasons had to be recorded if any other punishment was imposed). Now, judges needed to provide special reasons for why they imposed the death sentence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">These amendments also introduced the possibility of a post-conviction hearing on sentence, including the death sentence, in <b>Section 235(2), which states: If the accused is convicted, the Judge shall, unless he proceeds in accordance with the provisions of section 360, hear the accused on the question of sentence, and then pass sentence on him according to law.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Santa Singh v State of Punjab, 1976 </b>It envisages that after a Court holds a person guilty, it must consider the question of sentencing in the light of various factors such as the prior <b>criminal record of the offender</b>, <b>his age, employment, educational background, home life, sobriety and social adjustment, emotional and mental condition, and the prospects of his returning to normal path of conformity with the law</b>. It was therefore considered that the accused as well as the prosecution should be given an opportunity to put forward their viewpoints on the question of the sentence. This sub-section requires the Court to give a hearing to the accused on the question of the sentence. It is mandatory.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Supreme Court on Validity of Capital Punishment in India:</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Article 21 of the Indian Constitution ensures the Fundamental <b>Right to life and liberty for all persons</b>. It adds no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to <b>procedure established by law</b>. This has been legally construed to mean if there is a procedure, which is fair and valid, then the state by framing a law can deprive a person of his life. While the <b>central government has consistently maintained </b>it would keep the death penalty in the statute books to <b>act as a deterrent</b>, and for <b>those who are a threat to society</b>, the Supreme Court too has upheld the constitutional validity of capital punishment in “rarest of rare” cases.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In <b>Jagmohan Singh vs State of Uttar Pradesh (1973</b>), then in <b>Rajendra Prasad vs State of Uttar Pradesh (1979)</b>, and finally in <b>Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab (1980), </b>the Supreme Court affirmed <b>the constitutional validity of the death penalty</b>. It said that if capital punishment is provided in the law and the procedure is a <b>fair, just and reasonable </b>one, the death sentence can be awarded to a convict. This will, however, only be in the “<b>rarest of rare</b>” cases, and the courts should render “<b>special reasons</b>” while sending a person to the gallows.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Criteria for Rarest of Rare</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The principles as to what would constitute the “<b>rarest of rare</b>” has been laid down by the top Court in the landmark judgment in <b>Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab (1980). </b>Supreme Court formulated certain broad illustrative guidelines and said it should be given only when the option of awarding the sentence of life imprisonment is “unquestionably foreclosed”. It was left completely upon the court’s discretion to reach this conclusion. However, the apex court also laid down the principle of <b>weighing, aggravating and mitigating circumstances</b>. A balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in a particular case has to be drawn to ascertain whether justice will not be done if any punishment less than the death sentence is awarded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Two prime questions, the top court held, may be asked and answered<span class="p">.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders the sentence of</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence<span class="p">?</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Are there circumstances of the crime such <b>that there is no alternative </b>but to impose the death sentence <b>even after according maximum weightage </b>to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offenders</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In the last few years, <b>Supreme Court has entrenched the punishment of “full life” </b>or life sentence of determinate number of years as a response to challenges presented in death cases. The Supreme Court speaking through a three-judge bench decision in <b>Swamy Shraddhanand case </b>laid the foundation of this emerging penal option in following terms:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">“The matter may be looked at from a slightly different angle. The issue of sentencing has two aspects. <b>A sentence may be excessive and unduly harsh or it may be highly</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">disproportionately inadequate. <span class="p">When an appellant comes to this Court carrying a death sentence awarded by the trial court and confirmed by the High Court, this Court may find, as in the present appeal, that the case just falls short of the rarest of the rare category and may feel somewhat </span>reluctant in endorsing the death sentence<span class="p">.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">But at the same time, having regard to the nature of the crime, the Court may strongly feel that a sentence of life imprisonment subject to remission normally works out to a term <b>of 14 years would be grossly disproportionate and inadequate. </b>What then should the Court do? If the Court&#39;s option is limited only to two punishments, one a sentence of imprisonment, for all intents and purposes, of not more than 14 years and the other death, the Court may feel tempted and find itself nudged into endorsing the death penalty.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Such a course would indeed be disastrous. A far more <b>just, reasonable and proper </b>course would be to expand the options and to take over what, as a matter of fact, lawfully belongs to the Court i.e. the vast hiatus between 14 years imprisonment and death. It needs to be emphasised that the Court would take recourse to the expanded option primarily because in the facts of the case, <b>the sentence of 14 years imprisonment would amount to no punishment at all.</b></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Further, the formalisation of a special category of sentence, though for an extremely few number of cases, shall have the great advantage of having the death penalty on the statute book but to actually use it as little as possible, really in the rarest of rare cases   &quot;.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The observations in <b>Swamy Shraddhanand  case </b>have been followed by the Court in a multitude of cases such as <b>Haru Ghosh v. State of West Bengal</b>, S<b>tate of Uttar Pradesh v. Sanjay Kumar , Sebastian v. State of Kerala, Gurvail Singh v. State of Punjab </b>where full life or sentence of determinate number of years has been awarded as opposed to death penalty.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Clemency Powers</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">If the Supreme Court turns down the appeal against capital punishment, a condemned prisoner can submit a mercy petition to the President of India and the Governor of the State.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Under <b>Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution, the President and Governors, respectively have the power “to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence” </b>. Neither of these powers are personal to the holders of the Office, but are to be exercised (under Articles 74 and 163, respectively) on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Clemency powers, while exercisable for a wide range of considerations and on protean occasions, also function as the final safeguard against possibility of judicial error or miscarriage of justice. This casts a heavy responsibility on those wielding this power and necessitates a full application of mind, <b>scrutiny of judicial records</b>, and <b>wide-ranging inquiries </b>in adjudicating a clemency petition, especially one from a prisoner under a judicially confirmed death sentence who is on the very verge of execution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The Supreme Court in <b>Shatrughan Chauhan case </b>has recorded that the Home Ministry considers the following factors while deciding mercy petitions:</p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="a)"><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Personality of the accused (such as age, sex or mental deficiency) or circumstances of the case (such as provocation or similar justification);</p></li><li data-list-text="b)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Cases in which the appellate Court expressed doubt as to the reliability of evidence but has nevertheless decided on conviction;</p></li><li data-list-text="c)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Cases where it is alleged that fresh evidence is obtainable mainly with a view to see whether fresh enquiry is justified;</p></li><li data-list-text="d)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Where the High Court on appeal reversed acquittal or on an appeal enhanced the sentence;</p></li><li data-list-text="e)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Is there any difference of opinion in the Bench of High Court Judges necessitating reference to a larger Bench;</p></li><li data-list-text="f)"><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">Consideration of evidence in fixation of responsibility in gang murder case;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="g)"><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">Long delays in investigation and trial etc.</p></li></ol></body></html>
