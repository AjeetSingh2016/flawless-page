Another important aspect of a crime is that it affects the public interest, rather than the rights of a single individual, which shall be a part of civil law. In India, criminal law is operated through substantive as well as procedural law. The substantive law includes the Indian Penal Code, </a><a href="https://www.indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/16225?sam_handle=123456789/1362" class="a" target="_blank">1860 (the Code), and the procedural law includes the Code of Criminal Procedure, </a>1973 (Cr.P.C.). These laws implicitly and also various cases have enunciated that in the commission of a crime, there exist four stages.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Stages of Crime</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The stages of crime or elements of a crime include <b>intention, preparation, attempt and Comission</b>. The constitution of a crime includes all the elements. Some of these elements are even punishable before the Comission of the crime.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Intention</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The fundamental elements of a crime are ‘<b>mens rea’ and ‘actus reus’</b>, the former being the intention to commit a crime and the latter being the act done in furtherance of the intention. The criminal liability of a person shall be decided only when he or she has a mala fide intention. It is the direction of conduct towards the objects chosen upon considering the motive which suggests the choice. <b>Mere intention shall not constitute a crime, as it is almost impossible to know the intentions of a person. </b>A criminal liability at this stage cannot be drawn.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Mens Rea literally means <b>guilty mind. </b>This basically implies that a person committing the crime is mindful of his/her actions and knows that accomplishment of that act would result in a crime. To simplify, the intention of the person committing a crime should be mala fide.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Further, mens rea can be further divided into <b>four levels depending upon the degree of intent </b>of committing the crime.</p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="A."><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Negligence<span class="p">: This is the least and in fact the </span>mildest form of mens rea <span class="p">where the person is negligent of his/her actions and does not ensure reasonable care in his/her act/omission.</span></h1></li><li data-list-text="B."><h1 style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Recklessness: <span class="p">This is of a </span>slightly higher amplitude than negligence <span class="p">where the person can anticipate the crime which may arise out of the act/omission but did not expect or intended the same and acts negligently.</span></h1></li><li data-list-text="C."><h1 style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Knowledge<span class="p">: The </span>third level is knowledge where the person is associated <span class="p">with the risks that may occur on his act/omission and still continues with such act/omission.

It may be defined as an action in furtherance of the intention and preparation of a person to commit a crime. Thus, an attempt to commit a crime is often termed “<b>preliminary crime</b>”. An attempt to commit a crime is punishable under the Code. It has been provided under various provisions for specific crimes. However, in case of the absence of punishment for an <b>attempt to commit a particular crime</b>, Section 511 of the Code comes into the picture. Some of the specific provisions of the Code under which an attempt to commit a crime have been enumerated hereunder:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l4"><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Section 121 – Attempt to wage a war;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Section 131 – Attempt to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from his duty;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Section 307 – Attempt to murder;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Section 308 – Attempt to culpable homicide;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Section 309 – Attempt to suicide;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Section 326B – Attempt to throw suicide;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Section 356 – Attempt to commit theft;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Section 357 – Attempt to wrongfully confine a person;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Section 393 – Attempt to Commit Robbery;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Section 397 – Robbery or dacoity with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In the 19th century, English law established that <b>an attempt to commit an impossible act shall not be punishable</b>. Cases of the early 19th century were decided on the notion that an attempt cannot be made on a crime that cannot be committed. Thus, where a pickpocket thrusts his hand in an empty pocket of a person, he shall still not be held liable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">However, the courts found the notion to be illogical and unreasonable in the later part of the 19th century, <b>and hence, overruled the judgements</b>. <b>This was the first time an attempt to commit an impossible act was made punishable.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 511 of the Code particularly provides that any attempt to commit an impossible act is punishable. <span class="p">The illustrations provided under the provision are indicative of the same. Thus, under the Indian Penal Code, an attempt to commit an impossible act is punishable.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Difference between preparation and attempt</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The difference between the preparation and attempt to commit a crime is a crucial one. It can determine the criminal liability of a person. The prime difference between the two is the fact that <b>whether the act that has already been finished during the stages of crime</b>, has an impact on the victim. If it has an impact, <b>it is considered to be an attempt, otherwise, it is considered to be mere preparation</b>. The Courts in various cases have attempted to differentiate between the two through various tests..</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The difference between attempt and preparation has always been disputed. But there have been many academic tests in demarcating what attempt and preparation is. We shall first set out the main differences:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><h1 style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">First, preparation is the procurement of the means of attempting the crime <span class="p">while the attempt is the direct movement towards committing the crime after the commencement.</span></h1></li><li data-list-text=""><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Secondly, preparations are not punishable <span class="p">but attempts are…</span></h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reasons why preparation is not punishable</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Preparations are usually harmless acts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is near <b>impossible to prove that preparation was done in order to commit </b>that crime, and even if the preparation was done with mischief in mind, one might have changed his mind on the way.</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">If preparation is made punishable then offences in the statutes would increase by tenfold</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Mere preparation <b>does not cause harm or does not raise alarm </b>in society.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The general rule under the law is that the preparation of a crime shall not be punishable. The reason behind the general rule is that it is nearly impossible to prove that the accused made the preparation to execute the crime. Apart from this, the test of locus poenitentiae (<b>This test explains that, a person cannot be charged for an attempt if he is in position to give up or abandon his plan out of his own accord after the formation of Mens rea. </b>Such intentional withdrawal prior to the commission or attempt to commit the act will be termed as mere preparation for the commission of the crime and no legal liability will be imposed.) is applied in cases <b>where the culpability of preparation is in question. </b>The test provides that a person has an opportunity to withdraw from his act before he actually commits the intended crime.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Mens rea is the intention to commit the crime while actus reus is a guilty act. In (<b>R vs Mohan 1976</b>), a specific attempt was defined as the ‘<b>decision to bring a certain condition to the aim’</b>. The question judges must ask themselves when making a <b>demarcation between mere preparation and attempt to commit the crime </b>is usually a question of fact. It is very hard to lay down any hard rules or mechanical set of principles for drawing this line of demarcation. There have been tests which have been set down. They are discussed below:</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Proximity Test</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This test states that an act or <b>series of acts if considered an offence of all the essential steps </b>that constitute the crime have been committed and the only consequence of the crime has not taken place. The act of attempt should be sufficiently proximate to the crime.

This test is based on the principle that punishment is meant to deter people from acting in a way that is harmful to society. Until the offender’s conduct is seen as serious, there is no reason to deter it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Test of locus poenitentiae</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This test means that the law provided time to <b>every offender before he is in the grips of the law. </b>If he is still in the stages where he can undo his crime and not follow up with his crime, then the law will not punish him. If he follows through with his criminal design, it will be said he has crossed the stage of preparation.

The provisions of the Code provide for specific punishments for various crimes in the country. Undisputedly, at the level of accomplishment, <b>the criminal liability of a person shall arise</b>. Nevertheless, the above discussion reveals how the liability can commence even at the stage of the attempt and in some cases, even at the stage of preparation. Usually, in such instances, the crime committed is very serious and poses a threat to society. Hence, <b>the main object of ascertaining liability at such stages is to create a deterrent effect </b>in the minds of people and prevent them from committing such heinous crimes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In Madan Lal v. State of Rajasthan, 1986, <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1279834/" class="a" target="_blank">the convict was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for two years when found guilty of attempting to commit rape of the victim under </a>Section 376 read with Section 511 of the Code<span class="p">. The facts of the case included three prime witnesses, who found the convict laid down naked on the victim, who was also found naked, and the mouth of the victim was covered by the convict’s hand. It was established</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">the convict himself removed his clothes and that of the victim and had an intention to rape the victim.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Court, while analysing the stage of attempt, held that “<b>It is the stage beyond preparation and it precedes the actual commission of the offence</b>. An attempt to commit an offence is not meant <b>to cover only the penultimate act towards the completion </b>of an offence but it also covers all those acts or series of acts which travel beyond the scope of preparation and exhibit a definite intention and determination to commit a particular offence. It need not be an act which just precedes the last act on the happening of which the offence itself is committed but it covers all those acts or series of acts which may precede the <b>penultimate act towards the commission </b>of that offence.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In Case <b>State of Madhya Pradesh v. Narayan Singh (1989) </b>the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the <b>commission of an offence involves four stages</b>; i.e. intention, preparation, attempt and commission. <b>The first two stages of these offences would not attract culpability</b>, however, the last two stages would attract it. In this case, the respondents were trying to <b>export fertilisers without a permit from Madhya Pradesh to Maharashtra</b>. Hence, the act was considered to be an attempt of the offence rather than just preparation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In case <b>Mathivanan vs state of Tamil Nadu</b>, the Madras High Court reiterated that the first and the second stage (intention and preparation) are generally not culpable, whereas the third and <b>the fourth stage (attempt and accomplishment) </b>are culpable. However, exceptions to this general notion are the offences under Section 122 and Section 399 of the Code.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Commenting on Section 122 of the Code, the Court opined that “<b>To wage war would require several steps and crossing of stages</b>. There has to be mobilisation of men as well as accumulation of arms and ammunition. That would require a concerted effort. Each individual who is a party to the conspiracy to wage war may be allotted a particular task.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One may be tasked with collecting men, another with arms and the third with ammunition.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The expression “<b>otherwise prepares” in this context should not be construed on the</b></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">application of the principle of ‘ejusdem generis’<span class="p">. A person may be engaged in fund-raising. Another may be responsible for providing reinforcements. Some may be engaged in making logistical arrangements. Some may be engaged in the intellectual front. There could be several dimensions. All of them would fall within the scope of “otherwise prepares”. But as already held, when it comes to application of the provision to concrete facts, courts will apply a higher threshold.”</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">And as per <b>Abhayanand Mishra vs The State Of Bihar </b>There is a thin line between the <b>preparation for and an attempt to commit an offence</b>. Undoubtedly, a culprit first intends to commit the offence, then makes preparation for committing it and thereafter attempts to commit the offence. <b>If the attempt succeeds, he has committed the offence</b>; if it fails due to reasons beyond his control, he is said to have attempted to commit the offence.</p></body></html>
