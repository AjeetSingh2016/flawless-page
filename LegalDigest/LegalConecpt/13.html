They considered marriage as a sacred concept. According to Manu, the husband and wife cannot be separated from each other, their martial tie cannot be broken. Later the concept of divorce came in the picture and established as a custom to put the marriage to an end.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">According to the <b>Arthashastra, </b>marriage can end if dissolved by mutual consent and should be unapproved marriage. But <b>Manu does not believe in the concept of the dissolution</b>. According to Manu the only way to end the marriage is <b>the death of one of the spouses</b>. The provision related to the concept of divorce was introduced by the Hindu Marriage Act,1955. The Hindu Marriage Act defines divorce as a dissolution of the marriage. For the interest of the society, the marriage or the marital relationship needs to be surrounded by every safeguard for the cause specified by law.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Different theory of Divorce</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Fault Theory<span class="p">: Under this theory, marriage can be ended when one party to the marriage is responsible or </span>liable for the offence under matrimonial offences <span class="p">done against another spouse. Only the innocent spouse can seek this remedy. The only drawback of this theory is when both the spouse are at fault, then no one can seek these remedy of divorce.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Mutual consent: <span class="p">Under this theory, the marriage </span>can be dissolved by mutual consent<span class="p">. If both the spouse mutually </span>gives their consents to end the marriage<span class="p">, they can take the divorce. But many philosophers criticise this theory as this concept is immoral and leads to hasty divorce.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Irretrievable Breakdown<span class="p">: According to this theory, the dissolution of marriage happens due to failure of the matrimonial relationship.

After marriage, the husband leaves the wife in his home town so that she can complete her studies and go to another city for work. He visited twice or thrice a month to meet her.

The physical cruelty means when one spouse beats or causes any bodily injury to the other spouse. But the concept of mental cruelty was added as the spouse can also be mentally tortured by the other spouse. <b>Mental Cruelty is lack of kindness which adversely affects the health of the person.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Well it is easy to determine the nature of physical cruelty but difficult to say about mental cruelty Under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 as amended by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976<b>, cruelty is a ground for divorce as well as for judicial separation. Section 13 (1) (ia) states that a marriage may be dissolved on the ground that the other party has &quot;after the solemnisation of the marriage, treated the petitioner with cruelty&quot;. </b>Prior to 1976, cruelty was only a ground for judicial separation<b>.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Chetan Kumar Naik vs Geetaben, 2012</b>, (where decree of judicial separation converted to a divorce) Cruelty can be of Number of types It could be physical or mental, direct or indirect, intended or unintended.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As observed by the Supreme Court in <b>Vishwanath Sitaram Agarwal v Sarla</b>:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">“The expression &#39;cruelty&#39; has an inseparable nexus with human conduct or human behaviour.

In words of Lord Watson &#39;any definition would be either so wide as to be nugatory, or too narrow to fit in the ever varying events of human life…such sedimentary terms elude aprioric definition but can be illustrated, not defined.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Desertion</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Desertion in simple terms can also be considered as an act of abandoning a person. Thus it had been defined <b>under Section 10(ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955</b>. It states that divorce can happen if the petitioner had been deserted by the respondent for a continuous period of two years immediately after preceding the presentation of the petition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Explanation - In this sub-section, the expression desertion <b>means the desertion of the petitioner by the other party to the marriage without reasonable cause and without the consent or against the wish of such party</b>, and includes the wilful neglect of the petitioner by the other party to the marriage, and its grammatical variations and cognate expressions shall be construed accordingly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;"><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1461067/" class="s2" target="_blank">In the case of </a>Jyothi Pai v.
