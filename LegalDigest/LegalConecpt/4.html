Several reforms were recommended after the <b>Nirbhaya incident in Delhi in 2012</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Concept of Consent in rape cases</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">In a controversial judgement of <b>Mahmood Farooqui vs State of Delhi</b>, the Delhi high court has acquitted Peepli Live’s director Mahmood Farooqui of rape charges.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The argument for acquittal was that the victim merely resisted the sexual assault and the concept of ‘negation of consent’ was not clear. This has sparked a debate on how consent should be implied when one says no in a hesitant manner.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Consent is the only principle that provides any kind of difference between sexual intercourse and rape<span class="p">. In most cases, it is difficult to prove consent due to the lack of eyewitnesses. In the Indian Penal Code, Section 375 states that an offence is considered as </span>rape if the consent of the women is not obtained or is obtained by putting someone in fear of their life or their physical integrity<span class="p">. In Section 375 as explained, consent refers to –an agreement that a woman voluntarily gives up before a specific sexual act is performed. This means that a woman may have agreed to participate in the act if she says so verbally or in non-verbal communication.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">To put in simple words, <b>Consent must be voluntary, verbal, or non-verbal</b>. The person who gives consent must be capable of giving it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Burden of proof under the Indian Evidence Act</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The concept of burden of proof is based on the idea of <b>onus probandi and factum probans</b>. The burden of proof remains constant, while the onus shifts from one party to another.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The facts that are needed to be proved are those that are not self-evident. In the case of <b>Jarnail Sen Vs State of Punjab</b>, it was observed that in case of failure on part of prosecution to add satisfactory evidence to discharge the burden of proof on them then they cannot depend on the evidence adduced by the accused for their defence.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The principle remains the same in criminal cases, which is that the burden of proof is on the <b>prosecutors to prove that the accused committed a crime</b>. If they fail to do so, the accused is entitled to be acquitted.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 102 of Indian Evidence Act, <b>aims to find the party which has the burden of proof, </b>and that it is upon the <b>one who asserts a fact rather than the one who objects or denies it</b>. The burden of proof lies on the party whose claims will fail or be rejected if there is no evidence provided.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 103 imposes the <b>burden of proof on the party who wishes the court to believe </b>and act upon a fact. The principle does not apply to the fact that a particular statement is not true or that there is a negative or affirmative aspect to it.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 104 states that, when <b>admissibility of a particular fact depends on the existence </b>and <b>admissibility of another fact</b>, the party that wants to prove it will have to make the subsequent fact admissible.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In cases of custodial rape, dowry death, suicide of a married women, and absence of consent in rape, the burden of proof is on the accused. <b>This is in contrast to the principle of the burden being placed on the accused.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History of Section 114A of Evidence law</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Mathura Rape case was the reason behind the insertion of this section. The decision of the Supreme Court, in this case, was widely ridiculed in the country. Thus, the government decided to revamp the laws and it passed the Criminal Amendment Act, 1983. Let’s delve further into this case.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Herein, a girl named Mathura fled with her boyfriend Ashoka. Her family registered a complaint against her boyfriend. The girl, her boyfriend, her brother Gama and other relatives were called to the police station to settle the matter. The investigation was</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">completed and everybody was asked to go back. But Mathura was asked to stay back. It was alleged that a police constable Ganpat took Mathura to a chhapri and raped her. After he had satisfied his lust, another policeman Tukaram came there and fondled her private parts. The case went to the <b>Sessions Court which held that the policemen were not guilty</b>. They said that Mathura might have invented the story. The High Court took a different stance on the case. It said that <b>mere passive surrender of the body would not amount to consent on the part of the plaintiff</b>. The Court commented that the overtures might have come from the policemen themselves and not from Mathura. Further, on appeal, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the High Court. It held that she submitted her <b>body to the policemen as she did not resist</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Hon’ble Court said that the “o<b>nus is always on the prosecution to prove affirmatively each ingredient of the offence it seeks to establish and such onus never shifts.</b>” The judgment was criticized and there was an uproar in the country. Gender-based violence came to the forefront and it was at that time <b>Section 114-A was inserted in the Indian Evidence Act. </b><a href="https://www.indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/15357?locale=en" class="a" target="_blank">It was substituted by the Amendment Act </a>of 2013 and then recently by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/CSdivTheCriminalLawAct_14082018.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">the </a><a href="https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/CSdivTheCriminalLawAct_14082018.pdf" target="_blank">Amendment Act of 2018.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 29 of POCSO Act, 2012<span class="p">, Where a person is prosecuted for committing or abetting or attempting to commit any offence under sections 3, 5, 7 and section 9 of this Act, the Special Court shall presume, that such person has committed or abetted or attempted to commit the offence, as the case may be unless the contrary is proved.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">To prove that she was a victim of rape<b>, a woman does not need to prove that she was actively resisting the attack that was being committed on her</b>. And these factors not being prevented does not indicate that a woman has already given consent. This has been stated by the Supreme Court’s in its previous rulings. It stated that it is not necessary for a victim to resist a rape attempt actively keeping in regard for situations where the victim might fear for her life or even death.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Burden of Proof in Rape Cases in different countries</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The concept of Consent is also the same in Canada and the UK. Both the Canadian Criminal Code as well as the UK’s Sexual Offences Act, 2003, laws explicitly define consent. The Canadian Criminal Code (Section 273) requires <b>Consent has to be categorically given.</b></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Nothing short of voluntary consent or agreement would be acceptable. <span class="p">The burden of proof is on the accused to show that he or she took the necessary steps to ensure that the victim was consenting to the sexual activity. Which is similar to the principles in the UK’s Sexual Offences Act.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In Australia too, it has been stated that <b>consent is a determinative factor in deciding on sexual assault charges. </b>The burden is on the accused to show that he or she took the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">victim’s consent. In certain countries, the term rape refers to the presence of coercive circumstances instead of the lack of consent. This is because these instances usually occur when the victim does not consent to sexual activities.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In India, courts have a duty to <b>presume that consent is absent if a claim is made by the victim</b>, this is in accordance with the Indian Evidence Act 114A. This is a mode of ascertaining consent that is used in every civilized legal system. Surprisingly, This section was only added after the Supreme Court acquitted the accused in the Mathura rape case (Tukaram Vs State of Maharashtra in 1978.)</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">After this case was ruled out, there was a huge outcry since the accused was acquitted on the grounds that the victim did not resist during the incident and there were no visible signs of resistance meaning that the consent of the victim was not negated while committing the act which led to an amendment of the Section 114A of the Evidence Act in 1983.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">After the victim has <b>alleged absence of consent</b>, the onus is on the accused to dispel the presumption against him. The victim does not have to establish any further evidence to</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">prove absence of <b>consent for the accused to be presumed guilty</b>. This presumption is vested in favour of the victim in such cases.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In many cases, the Supreme Court has held that the burden of proof is on the accused to <b>prove that the victim did not consent to the sexual activity</b>. In this case, the victim’s testimony may not be the sole basis for a conviction. Other factors such as consistency of the victims statements and other factors that are laid down in the Evidence Act may also be taken into account.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The judgement in the Farooqui case, which deals with the issue of rape, has made several observations that will have ramifications in cases pending before the courts. The Supreme Court has sought to clear up its <b>controversial ruling on the meaning of consent for sexual assault victims</b>, which suggests that a woman would have to say no in verbal words in and any hesitation shall amount to consenting to the sexual assault that is being committing on her at that moment.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This kind of observation could transfer the burden of proof of sexual consent to the victim, which could be very disastrous to certain groups of victims who may be in a disadvantageous situation. Instead of providing a strong defence, this will make the victims weak and vulnerable.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This trial <b>would discourage victims from filing a complaint</b>, as it would shift the onus on them instead of the accused. It would also make them feel ashamed and less safe, especially in a society like India where rape is considered as a mark of disgrace. This will create a chink in their already vulnerable armor.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1092711/" class="a" target="_blank">After the case of </a><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1092711/" class="s2" target="_blank">Tukaram v. </a>the State of Maharashtra (1978)<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1586025/" class="a" target="_blank">, popularly known as the Mathura Rape case, the Indian Evidence Act was amended and </a><a href="https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/5429/1/criminal_law_%28amendment%29_act%2C_1983.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">Section 114-A was inserted via the Criminal Law Amendment Act, </a><span class="p">1983.

False promise to marry will not ipso facto make a person liable for rape if the prosecutrix is above 16 years of age and impliedly consented to the act.</p></body></html>
