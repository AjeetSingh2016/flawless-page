Even <b>section 499 of Indian Penal Code Read with the article 19(2) of Constitution prohibit defamation and put the restriction on freedom of speech and expression.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 499 Indian Penal Code (IPC, 1860) brings under the criminal law, the person who publishes as well as the person who <b>makes the defamatory imputation</b>. Section 499, IPC, 1860 emphasises the words <b>&quot;makes or publishes&quot;. </b>The gist of the offence of defamation lies in the dissemination of the harmful imputation. When a defamatory</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">statement is published, it is not only the publisher, but also the maker who becomes responsible and it is in that context that the word &quot;makes&quot; is used in section 499 IPC, 1860.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It is of essence that in order to constitute the offence of defamation, <b>it must be communicated to a third person because </b>what is intended by the imputation is to arouse hostility of others. In case <b>BRK murthy vs state 2013</b>, the essentials of defamation are, first, the words must be defamatory; second, they must refer to the aggrieved party; third, they must be maliciously published.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>ratanlal and Dheeraj lal </b>The term <b>&#39;person&#39; </b>includes not only the physical body and members but also every bodily sense and personal attribute among which is the reputation a man has acquired. Reputation can also be defined to be good name, the credit, honour or character which is derived from a favourable public opinion or esteem, and character by report. Although, <b>&#39;character&#39; and &#39;reputation&#39; are often used synonymously, these terms are distinguishable.</b></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Hon’ble court in case <b>kishor samrite vs State of UP, 2013 </b>distinguishes between character and Reputation <b>&#39;Character&#39; is what a man is </b>and <b>&#39;reputation&#39; is what he is supposed to be in what people say he is</b>. &#39;Character&#39; depends on attributes possessed and &#39;reputation&#39; on attributes which others believe one to possess. <b>The former signifies reality and the latter merely what is accepted to be reality at present.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Constitutional Validity of defamation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Critiques contended that it against the basic tenets of constitution against the law of land contrary to Article 19(1)(a). The Constitutional validity of sections 499 and 500 of IPC, 1860 and section 199 of Code of Criminal Procedure, (Cr PC, 1973) was assailed in <b>Subramanian Swamy v UOI, Ministry of Law, </b>and the Supreme Court upheld it. The Court observed thus:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">One cannot be unmindful that <b>right to freedom of speech and expression is a highly valued and cherished right but the Constitution conceives of reasonable restriction</b>. In that context criminal defamation which is in existence in the form of Section 499 and 500 Indian Penal Code is not a restriction on free speech that can be <b>characterized as disproportionate</b>. Right to free speech cannot mean that a citizen can defame the other. <b>Protection of reputation is a fundamental right</b>. It is also a human right. Cumulatively it serves the social interest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ingredients of section 499 of IPC</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The section requires three essentials -</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Making or <b>publishing any imputation </b>concerning any person.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Such <b>imputation must have been </b>made by</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a) words, either spoken or intended to be read; or (b) signs; or (c) <b>visible representations.</b></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Such imputation must have been made <b>with the intention of harming or with knowledge </b>or reason to believe that it will harm the reputation of the person concerning whom it is made.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="1."><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">&#39;Makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person&#39; <span class="p">- Everyone who composes, dictates, writes or in any way contributes to the making of a libel, is the maker of the libel.

Under <b>section 7 of the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867 </b>a presumption regarding awareness of the contents of a newspaper can be raised only <b>against the Editor whose name appears on the copy of the newspaper </b>and no other Editors like the News Editor or Resident Editor whose names do not appear in the declaration printed on the copy of the newspaper.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Publication <span class="p">- The defamatory matter must be published, that is, communicated to some person other than the person about whom it is addressed.

This reply was put on the official file by the President and it was read by the members of the Committee. It was held that there was publication of the defamation. The placing of the reply on the official file was not a gratuitous or voluntary act on the part of the President but it was his duty to do so, and the accused knew or must have known that the contents of his reply would be necessarily communicated to the members of the Committee .</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">&#39;Intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm&#39; <span class="p">- In this section the expression &quot;harm&quot; means harm to the reputation of the aggrieved party. It is not necessary to prove that the complainant actually suffered directly or indirectly from the scandalous imputation alleged; As per (Gobinda Pandey vs Garth, 1900) it is sufficient to show that the accused intended to harm, or knew, or had reason to believe that the imputation made by him would harm the reputation of the complainant.</span></h1></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>J. jayelalita vs Arcot N veerasamy, 1997 </b>The meaning to be attached to the word &#39;harm&#39; is not the ordinary sense in which it is used. <b>By &#39;harm&#39; is meant imputation on a man&#39;s character made </b>and expressed to others so as to lower him in their estimation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Anything which lowers him merely in his own estimation does not constitute defamation. As per Ratan lal Dheeraj lal A man&#39;s opinion of himself cannot be called his reputation.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distinction between Indian and English law</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The above basis of liability arising from publication, namely, that there should be communication at least with one person other than the defamed, is tenable only in the civil branch of the law of defamation, ie, in torts, whereas in crimes, the basis is breach of the peace and mischief to society. The gist of the offence in <b>English criminal law is whether the words written by the defendant have a tendency to provoke the breach of the peace</b>.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Thus, in the illustrations given above, if A&#39;s defamatory letters are directly addressed to B, they will be considered defamatory in criminal prosecutions only if their contents are calculated to <b>provoke B to do something, </b>which will disturb the Queen&#39;s peace in the locality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Publication in its primary sense as communication by the defendant to a person other than the person defamed, is the basis of liability in English civil law of defamation, in torts. This principle, which is not accepted as the basic principle of English penal law of defamation, is accepted as the basic principle of penal liability in the IPC (<b>Section 499, explanation 4</b>).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Thus, the basic principle of English civil law of defamation is made the underlying principle of the IPC in case of defamation. <b>Words that may have the effect of provoking another person at whom they are uttered are made punishable under s 504, IPC</b>, which deals with intentional insults offered with intent to provoke breach of the peace. The gist of the offence in s 499, IPC, seems to lie in the <b>tendency of the statements, verbal or written, to create that degree of pain</b>, which is felt by a person, who is subjected to unfavourable criticisms and comments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">There is another important difference between English law and Indian law in the matter relating to spoken defamation or slander. The latter cannot be the subject matter of criminal prosecution in England, except when it happens to be seditious or blasphemous. Slanderous words are never actionable criminally, except when they happen to be</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">utterances against the state or state religion. The IPC recognises no such distinction classifying both as punishable. There is a difference in provisions in India and England.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 499 of IPC and Section 199 of Code of Civil Procedure read with the 19(2) of<span class="h1"> </span>Constitution</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Section 199 deals with the <b>prosecution for Defamation </b>As per section 199(1) of Code of Criminal Procedure No Court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under Chapter XXI of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) except upon a complaint made by some person aggrieved by the offence:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Provided that where such person is under the age of eighteen years, or is an idiot or a lunatic, or is from sickness or infirmity unable to make a complaint, or is a woman who, according to the local customs and manners, <b>ought not to be compelled to appear in public</b>, some other person may, with the leave of the Court, make a complaint on his or her behalf.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">If the person aggrieved is under <b>eighteen, </b>or is a <b>lunatic or idiot, or incapable of lodging a complaint </b>because of sickness or infirmity or is a pardanashin lady, then with the permission of the Court, the complaint may be made by another person. The word &quot;infirmity&quot; in proviso to section 199(1) cannot be read down to mean infirmity resulting from ill-health or age.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">It comprehends &quot;<b>any deficiency, debility, disability or inadequacy, which the Court finds to be reasonable and sufficient to dispense </b>with the personal appearance of the complainant to present the complaint&quot;. As per <b>Fr Thomas Maniankerikalam v Thomas J Padiyath, 2003 </b>A person, who is away in a foreign country, suffers from infirmity and, therefore, he could present the complaint through his power of attorney.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">There are some exception to section where defamation is not punishable under Section<span class="h1"> </span>499 of IPC</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Exception 1 and Exception 4 <span class="p">of Section 499, require that the </span>imputation should be true<span class="p">. The remaining Exceptions do not require it to be so. They only require that it should be made in good faith. As per </span>Chandrasekhara v Karthikeyan, 1964, <span class="p">When truth is set up as a defence, it must extend to the entire libel and it is not sufficient that only a part of the libel is proved to be true.

As per <b>Janardhan Damodhar Dikshit, (1894) </b>A Court may find that an imputation is true, and made for the public good, but on considering the manner of the publication (e.g., in a newspaper) it may hold that the particular publication is not for the public good, and is, therefore, not privileged.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l3"><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Fair comments on the public conduct of public servants<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">If any statement or criticism is published regarding <b>a public servant discharging his public functions or his character</b>, in good faith and the scope of the statement only relates to the conduct, character or functions discharged in that position, then it would not amount to defamation.
