As a result, in a case of vicarious liability, both the individual and the other are responsible for the actions of the other. In a case of vicarious liability, both the person who orders the act and the person who performs the act are responsible. As a result, employers are held vicariously responsible for the torts incurred by their workers while on the job.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Liability of the <b>principal for the tort of his Agent</b>.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Liability of the <b>Partner’s of each other Tort.</b></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Liability of the <b>master for the tort of his Servant.</b></p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In the field of Torts it is considered to be an exception to the general rule that a person is liable for his own acts only. It is based on the principle of <b>qui facit per se per alium facit per se</b>, which means, “<b>He who does an act through another is deemed in law to do it himself</b>”. So in a case of vicarious liability both the person at whose behest the act is done as well as the person who does the act are liable. Thus, Employers are vicariously liable for the torts of their employees that are committed during the course of employment.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Essential ingredients under the vicarious liability<span class="p">:</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 231%;text-align: left;">There must be a <b>certain type of relation between the parties</b>.
