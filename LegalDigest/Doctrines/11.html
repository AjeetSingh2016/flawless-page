      The doctrine of Separation of Powers was originally started in the
      writings of Montesquieu in the spirit of the Laws where Montesquieu refers
      to the division of govt. responsibilities into three separate branches of
      government to make sure that none of the branch intrude into the domain of
      another. The true objective of introducing there principles was to prevent
      the concentration of power and provide for check and balances. American
      Constitution, Australian constitution is very rigid as compared to Indian
      constitution and it does not apply to India or even England.
      <b>Separation of Powers is practiced in India but not that rigidly</b>.
      The tree main areas of government in some or the other way perform the
      task of other.

      In the contemporary world constitutional systems all over world
      <b>might not follow a strict separation of powers </b>because that
      <b>is undesirable and at times impracticable</b>, however, the diluted
      form of this concept can been seen implemented in almost all the
      countries. It is widely accepted fact that for the political system to be
      stable, the holder of the power need to be balanced off against each
      other. The principle of separation of powers deals with the interrelation
      between the three major organ of the government, namely
      <b>legislature, executive and judiciary</b>.

      The history can be traced back to the
      <b>4th century B.C., when Aristotle </b>identified the three government
      agencies viz, in his treatise entitled politics. T<b
        >he General Assembly, the Police and the Judiciary</b
      >. A somewhat similar system existed in <b>Republican Rome</b>, consisting
      of <b>public assemblies, senates and officials</b>, all operating on the
      principle of checks and balances. Following the fall of the Roman Empire,
      Europe became fragmented into nation-states, and from the end of the end
      of the Middle Ages until the 18 century the dominant governmental
      structure consisted of a concentrated power residing in the hereditary
      ruler, the only exception being the development of the
      <b>English parliament in the 17th century</b>.

      With doctrine of the three branches of government reappeared with the
      <b>birth of the parliament, </b>this time in John Locke’s two government
      Treatise (1689), where these powers were described as legislative,
      administrative, and federative. Nevertheless, Locke did not consider the
      three divisions to be co-equal, nor did he consider them equipped for
      autonomous action.
      <b>He considered the legislative branch to be supreme</b>, while the
      executive federative functions respectively as internal and external
      affairs that were left under the control of the monarch, a scheme that
      obviously corresponded to the dual form of government that prevailed in
      England at the time, that is, the Parliament and The king.

      conditions of Constitution and there are no restrictions on its law-making

      Ordinarily, all the legislative power is vested in the legislature but in
      certain circumstances, the president may be empowered to exercise the
      legislative power. For example, the
      <b>president can issue ordinance under Article 123 </b>when the parliament
      is not in session, making the rules when there is an emergency. Judiciary
      also performs
      <b>the administrative actions while formulating the regulations </b>and
      giving guidance for the subordinate court as well as perform legislative
      powers by framing the rules regulating their own procedure.

      If we talk about the amending power of the Parliament under Article 368,
      it has been subject to the concept of the basic structure held in case
      <b>Keshavnanda bharti vs state of kerela </b>In this case, it was held
      that the Parliament couldn’t amend the provision in such a way that
      <b>violated the basic structure</b>. And if it is made in violation of
      basic structure then such amendment will be declared as unconstitutional
      null and void. Going through this case law regarding the Supreme court
      judgment it can be observed that the basic structure cannot be amended and
      strict applicability of doctrine can be seen.
