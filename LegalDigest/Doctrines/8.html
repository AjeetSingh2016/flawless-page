      The doctrine of ‘<b>pith and substance</b>’ says that where the question
      is about determining the power of legislature to make a particular law
      under the three lists, what the court must look into is the substance of
      the same. thus, the doctrine is used when the competence of the
      legislature is to be determined in relation to a particular enactment and
      what has to be looked into is the substance of the enactment. If it is
      found that the legislation is in substance on the matter assigned to the
      legislature then the enactment must be held to be valid completely. <br><br> It may
      so happen that the enactment incidentally encroaches upon the matter
      beyond the competence of a particular legislature, but such encroachments
      do not render the whole enactment to be a nullity. The legislative matters
      that are given under different lists are bound to overlap at some point
      but that does not make the whole enactment null and void. Thus, it can be
      concluded that incidental encroachments are permissible while determining
      the competence of the legislatures as far as the subject matters in the
      three lists are concerned.

      The doctrine of pith and substance was recognized for the
      <b>very first time in Canada</b>. Canada does not only have a common
      constitutional arrangement with India but also the cases in Canada went up
      to the privy council for the final appeal. Just like India has the center
      and state legislatures, Canada is divided as the Dominion and the
      Provinces.

      Although the first great model of federalism Canadian constitution makers
      went to add two lists in the Constitution of Canada. The constitution of
      Canada was initially enacted as the <b>British North America Act,1857</b>.
      <b>Section 69 </b>clearly bifurcated the powers given to the dominion and
      that given to the provinces. <b>Section 91 </b>of the act described the
      powers given exclusively to the Dominion while <b>section 92 </b>of the
      act described the powers given exclusively to the Provinces.

      It was emphasized that none of the two act or encroach upon other’s powers
      to make laws under the sections of the
      <b>British North American Act,1857</b>. This meant that the dominion could
      not act upon the area of the provinces and vice versa.

      Although, emphasis was laid for a clear distribution in the powers of the
      two yet inevitably the descriptions of the legislative fields provided in
      both the sections would often overlap. Thus, a statute when made looked as
      if it was acted encroaching upon the powers of the other. A provision made
      by one if really encroached upon the powers of the other, then it was
      invalid.

      The major question to be answered here is what was in real sense a field
      that belonged to either the province or the dominion as mentioned in
      <b>section 91 and 92 of the Act</b>. It was then that the Privy Council
      came up with a solution to the question (judicial decisions in Canada were
      subject to final appeal to the privy council back then). The Privy Council
      suggested that the <b>‘true nature and character’ </b>of the legislation
      must be looked into while deciding upon the
      <b>competence of the legislature</b>.

      The Doctrine of Pith and Substance states that if the substance of
      legislation falls within a legislature’s lawful power, the legislation
      does not become unconstitutional just because it impacts an issue beyond
      its area of authority. “True nature and character” is what the phrase
      “pith and substance” signifies. The Court uses it to determine whether the
      claimed intrusion is just incidental or significant. Thus, the ‘pith and
      substance’ concept holds that the challenged statute is fundamentally
      within the legislative competence of the legislature that enacted it but
      only incidentally encroaches on the legislative field of another
      legislature.

      In general, the Parliament and state legislatures are supposed to stay in
      their allocated sectors and
      <b>not trespass on each other’s jurisdiction</b>. To put it another way,
      the idea of pith and substance is used to identify which category a piece
      of legislation belongs to. However, the powers bestowed on each level are
      certain to intersect at some point. It is impossible to draw a clear line between the competencies of separate legislatures as
      they will inevitably overlap at times.

          Another important ground establishing a need for the doctrine in India
          is that if every legislation were to be declared invalid on the ground
          that it encroached on the subject of another legislature, then these
          powers assigned to the legislature would be enormously restrictive,
          and this would not serve the purpose of the power being granted to the

      In <b>K.Ramakrishnan vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu</b>, It is a well
      settled law that the matters enumerated in several entries in the List in
      VII Schedule are not powers but fields of legislation and liberal
      construction must be put on them. The overlapping of fields of legislation
      occurs for variety of reasons. A subject of legislation of wide scope may
      be divided between Union and State fields on account of which it would be
      impossible to prevent overlapping by a clear-cut division.

      The overlapping also occurs in several cases where exclusive field is in
      favour of the State, but the same is made subject to an exclusive field
      carved out which is reserved in favour of the Union. When it appears to
      the court that there is apparent overlapping between the two entries the
      doctrine of pith and substance has to be applied to find out the true
      nature of a legislation and the entry within which it would fall.

    It is
    only when an apparent overlapping occurs that the doctrine of pith and substance has to be applied to find
      out the true nature of legislation and the entry within which it would
      fall. When different entries in the same list crop up for consideration,
      the usual principle followed is that each particular entry should relate
      to a separate subject or group of subjects and every attempt should be
      made to harmonise different entries and to discard a construction which
      will render any of the entries ineffective.

      within the permissible field in pith and substance, objection would not be

      challenged on the ground that being a provincial (State) law, it affected
      promissory notes, a Central subject (Entry 46, List I). The Privy Council
      found that in its true nature and character, the legislation dealt with
      moneylenders and money-lending (Entry 30, List II), and not with
      promissory notes. The money-lenders commonly take a promissory note as
      security for a loan.

      A legislature would not, in any real sense, be able to deal with
      money-lending if it cannot limit the liability of a borrower in respect of
      a promissory note given by him. The Act was held valid even though as an
      ancillary effect it affected the negotiable instruments—a Central
      subject.(Also see <b>Subrahmanyan v. Muttuswami, 1941</b>).

      As per <b>Prof. MP Jain, </b>A State law enforcing prohibition is valid
      because it prohibits purchase, use, possession, transport and sale of
      liquor (Entry 8, List II), and it only incidentally encroaches on the
      Central power on imports (Entry 41, List I).

      As per <b>Krishna v. State of Madras, 1957</b>, A State prohibition law is
      valid even though it also deals with some aspects of evidence and criminal
      procedure which fall in the Concurrent List, for the law deals, in
      substance, with intoxicating liquors and only incidentally with evidence
      and criminal procedure.

      The Industrial Disputes Act enacted by Parliament, even though it applies
      to employees of municipalities, is valid as, in substance, it deals with
      <b>‘industrial and labour disputes’ </b>(Entry 22, List III), and not with
      <b>‘local government’ </b>(Entry 5, List II).(See
      <b>D.N. Banerji v. P.R. Mukherjee, 1953</b>).
