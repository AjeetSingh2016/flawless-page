It will claim that it doesn’t have jurisdiction. And it will leave that question to some other aspect of the political process to settle out.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 393pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">- <span class="h1">Prof. John E.

The idea of a political question is closely linked to the concept of Justiciability, as it comes down to a question of whether or not the Court System is an appropriate forum in which to hear the case. This is because the court system only has the authority to hear and decide a legal question, <b>not a political one. Legal questions </b>are deemed to be justiciable, while political questions are non-justiciable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Roots of Origin</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison" class="a" target="_blank">The  doctrine  has  its  roots  in  the  historic Supreme  court case  of </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison" class="s4" target="_blank">Marbury  v. </a>Madison (1803)<span class="p">. In that case, </span>Chief Justice John Marshall <span class="p">drew a distinction between two different functions of the US secretary of State. Marshall stated that when the Secretary of State was performing a purely discretionary matter, such as advising the President on matters of policy, he was not held to any legally identifiable standards. Therefore, some of the Secretary&#39;s actions are unable to be reviewed by a court of law. </span>Marshall argued that Courts  should  generally  not  hear  cases  where  political  questions  were  involved and individual <span class="p">rights were not implicated (later versions of the political question doctrine argued that it applied even if individual rights were at stake) in Marbury V.S Madinson.</span></h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Prior to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <b>Baker v. Carr</b>, the cases challenging the distribution of political power through apportionment and districting, weighed-voting, and restrictions on political action were held to present <b>non-justiciable p itical questions</b>. The basis of this doctrine was the <b>&quot;seeming conviction of the courts that the issues raised were well beyond the judicial responsibility&quot;.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In <b>Baker vs Carr 1962</b>,  the Court undertook a major rationalisation and formulation of the <b>&#39;political question doctrine&#39; </b>which led to considerable narrowing of its application. In the Baker opinion, the Court outlined six characteristics &quot; prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question,&quot; which include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l1"><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">&quot;a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">the impossibility of a court&#39;s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">departments on one question.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Position in India</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In <b>Ak Roy vs Union of India , [1982], </b>Chief Justice <b>Chandrachud </b>recognised that</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">the doctrine, which was essentially a function of the separation of powers in America, was to be adopted cautiously and said &quot;It must also be mentioned that in the United States itself, the doctrine of the political question has come under a cloud and has been the subject matter of adverse criticism. It is said that all that the doctrine really means is that in</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">the exercise of the power of judicial review, the courts must adopt a &#39;<b>prudential</b>&#39; attitude, which requires that they should be wary of deciding upon the merit of any issue in which claims of principle as to the issue and claims of expediency as to the power and prestige of courts are in sharp conflict. The result, more or less, is that in America the phrase &quot;political question&#39; has become &#39;a little more than a play of words&quot;.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 162pt;text-indent: -66pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Scholars have divided justiciability under this doctrine into<span class="h1"> </span>primary and secondary justiciability</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Primary justiciability decided whether a particular class of executive decision-making had any potential amenability to judicial review at all. If the threshold was met, justiciability would then also be considered in a secondary way, in determining whether particular decision-making could be reviewed on particular grounds.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.ssrn.com/abstract%3D3451971" class="a" target="_blank">In brief, primary justiciability referred to certain categories of political questions that were beyond the remit of the courts, whereas secondary justiciability referred to the grounds of review sought and whether a court had the necessary tools at its disposal to resolve the case, and to the standard of review applied by the reviewing </a><span class="p">court. Primary justiciability revolved </span>around subject matter<span class="p">, whereas secondary justiciability revolved </span>around grounds of review. <a href="https://ie.vlex.com/vid/haughey-v-moriarty-793178093" class="a" target="_blank">The distinction may best be explained through </a><a href="https://ie.vlex.com/vid/haughey-v-moriarty-793178093" class="s4" target="_blank">Haughey v </a>Moriarty<span class="p">, wherein it was held:</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">“Whether the Taoiseach or the government ought to invite a judge to be a sole member or other member of a tribunal is a policy matter on which the plaintiffs, like other citizens, are entitled to have their opinions. But it is a policy matter on which it would not be appropriate for this Court to express an opinion. This Court realises, however, the importance of the work which such tribunals may have to carry out in our system of government and sees no constitutional or legal objection to a judge being a member, or the sole member, of such a tribunal provided he or she is willing to serve and provided his or her absence from his or her normal duties does not impose an undue strain on the work of his or her court and has the approval of its President.”</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3451971" class="a" target="_blank">While the first highlighted portion might give the impression of the courts refraining from interfering on principles of primary justiciability, the second highlighted portion indicates that the court has in fact reviewed the constitutional appropriateness of appointment of judges to chair public inquiries.
