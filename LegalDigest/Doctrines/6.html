Such an interpretation is beneficial in avoiding any inconsistency or repugnancy either within a section or between a section and other parts of the statute this rule evolved from the case <b>Shankari Prasad v. Union of India </b>where there was a conflict between <b>part III and part IV of the constitution</b>. The Supreme Court used the principle of Harmonious construction and held that fundamental rights are the rights provided against the state where as the directive principles for the state policy are provided to the state to meet social and economic development of the country. In this case, the rule of harmonious construction was used by giving preferences to both fundamental rights and directive principles, as they both are important for public wellbeing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">When there is a conflict between two or more statues or two or more parts of a statute then the rule of harmonious construction needs to be adopted. Every statute has a purpose and intent as per law and should be read as a whole. While using the harmonious rule the interpretation should be consistent with all the provisions of the statute. In the case in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">which it shall be impossible to harmonize both the provisions, the court’s decision regarding the provision shall prevail. The basis of principle of harmonious construction probably is that the legislature must not have intended to contradict itself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Relevant Legal Provisions</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 367(1): <span class="p">Unless the context otherwise requires, the </span>General Clauses Act, 1897<span class="p">, shall, subject to any adaptations and modifications that may be made therein under Article 372, apply for the interpretation of this Constitution as it applies for the interpretation of an Act of the Legislature of the Dominion of India.</span></h1><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 372(1): <span class="p">Notwithstanding the repeal by this Constitution of the enactments referred to in Article 395 but subject to the other provisions of this Constitution, all the laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, all the laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall continue in force therein until altered or repealed or amended by a competent Legislature or other competent authority.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>CIT v. Hindustan bulk carriers, 2003 </b>The Supreme Court of India has given <b>five principles of Harmonious Construction </b>–</p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="a."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The courts must avoid a head on clash of seemingly contradicting provisions and they must construe the contradictory provisions so as to harmonize them.</p></li><li data-list-text="b."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The provision of one section cannot be used to defeat the provision contained in another unless the court, despite all its effort, is unable to find a way to reconcile their differences.</p></li><li data-list-text="c."><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">When it is impossible to completely reconcile the differences in contradictory provisions, the courts must interpret them in such as way so that effect is given to both the provisions as much as possible.</p></li><li data-list-text="d."><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Courts must also keep in mind that interpretation that reduces one provision to a useless number, is not harmonious construction.</p></li><li data-list-text="e."><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: justify;">To harmonize is not to destroy any statutory provision or to render it loose.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Venkatraman Devaru v. State of Mysore </b>the court applied harmonious construction where it has tried to resolve such dispute by giving its interpretation to these two Articles of the Constitution. Thus, the court has observed that the right of a religious denomination to manage its own affairs under Art. 26(b) is subject to the law made by the state for providing social welfare as well as subject to Art. 25(2) (b).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Qureshi v. State of Bihar</b>, In this case Supreme Court held that the state should implement directive principle in a way so as that it will not interfere fundamental right.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Bhatia international v. bulk trading (2003) </b>It was held that if more than one interpretation is possible for a statute than the court has to choose the interpretation which shows the intention of the legislature. In <b>P.S Sattappan v. Andhra bank ltd. (2004) </b>The supreme court held observed that one cannot interpret a section in a manner which would lead to a conflict between two sub sections of the same sections.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>Union of India v. Dileep Kumar Singh, </b>the apex court held that the provisions of statute must be read harmoniously together. Where this is not possible and there is irreconcilable conflict between two sections, it must be determined which provision is leading provision and which provision is subordinate provision and that which one must give way to the other.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">But, with regard to the above judgment, in <b>Special Reference No. 1 of 1964 </b>, it was decided that Article 194(3) is subordinate to Articles 21, 32, 211 and 226. This conclusion was also reached by recourse to the rule of harmonious construction.</p></body></html>
