</style></head><body><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introduction</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In 1951, it passed the <b>first amendment to the Constitution </b>which created articles 31A and 31B. These articles would provide the origin of the dispute that would ultimately create the basic structure doctrine. Article 31A stated that <b>any acquisition of property by the state </b>through law could not be called into question under the rights to property, equality,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">freedom of speech, or freedom to practice one’s profession.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 31B <b>created the Ninth Schedule</b>, a list of laws inserted in the back of the Constitution Laws that were placed into this schedule through Constitutional amendment could not be found invalid by the <b>judiciary on the basis of any of the fundamental rights</b>. In the First Amendment, thirteen land reform laws were placed into this protected schedule.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Although the First Amendment only protected land reform laws, the Ninth Schedule could, on its face, be used to protect any law placed into it from fundamental rights review.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tussel Starts between Judiciary and Legislature</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">After the passage of these two Articles, a showdown between Parliament and the judiciary became almost inevitable. Parliament had amended the Constitution to shield not only expropriation laws, but potentially any law from fundamental rights review. With the very idea of meaningful judicial review under attack, the Court’s potential responses were limited. It could acquiesce to the amendment, admitting that it could be stripped of its power of judicial review, and hope a later Parliament would remove the offending articles, or, alternatively, it could search for a way to defend judicial review.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Property owners challenged the Constitutional amendments which placed land reforms laws in the <b>Ninth Schedule before the Supreme Court, saying that they violated Article 13</b></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">(2) of the Constitution<span class="p">. Article 13 (2) provides for the protection of the fundamental rights of the citizen Parliament and the state legislatures are clearly prohibited from making laws that may take away or abridge the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizen. They</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">argued that any amendment to the Constitution had the status of a law as understood by Article 13 (2). In <b>1952 (Sankari Prasad case</b>) xviii and <b>1955 (Sajjan Singh’s case</b>) the Supreme Court rejected both arguments and upheld the power of Parliament to amend any part of the Constitution including that <b>which affects the fundamental rights of citizens</b>.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Significantly though, two dissenting judges in Sajjan Singh’s case raised doubts whether the</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">fundamental rights of citizens could become a plaything of the majority party in Parliament.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The first attempt by the Court to salvage its review power came in <b>1967 in Golak Nath v. State of Punjab</b>, which challenged articles 31A and 31B. An eleven-judge bench of the Supreme Court reversed its position. Delivering its 6:5 majority judgement Chief Justice Subba Rao put forth the curious position that Article 368, that contained provisions related to the amendment of the Constitution, <b>merely laid down the amending procedure</b>. Article 368 did not confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution. The amending power (constituent power) of <b>Parliament arose from other provisions contained in the Constitution (Articles 245, 246, 248) </b>which gave it the power to make laws (plenary legislative power). Thus, the apex court held that the amending power and legislative powers of Parliament were essentially the same. Therefore, any amendment of the Constitution must be deemed law as understood in Article 13(2). It is subjected to judicial review.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The majority judgment invoked the concept of implied limitations on Parliament&#39;s power to amend the Constitution. This view held that the Constitution gives a place of permanence to the fundamental freedoms of the citizen. In giving the Constitution to themselves, the people had reserved the fundamental rights for themselves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 13, according to the majority view, expressed this limitation on the powers of Parliament. Parliament could not modify, restrict or impair fundamental freedoms due to this very scheme of the Constitution and the nature of the freedoms granted under it. The judges stated that the fundamental rights were so sacrosanct and transcendental in</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">importance that they could not be restricted even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval of both houses of Parliament.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">They observed that a Constituent Assembly might be summoned by Parliament for the purpose of amending the fundamental rights if necessary. In other words, the apex court held that some features of the Constitution lay at its core and required much more than the usual procedures to change them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The verdict in <b>Golaknath’s case </b>led to direct conflict of power between the parliament and judiciary. The ruling government suffered heavy losses of votes in parliamentary elections as it failed to fulfill its promises. The power conflict led the government to introduce a bill seeking to <b>restore supremacy of parliament </b>which was later not pressed because of some political compulsions. But hungry to prove it supreme, parliament again, under the pretext of ensuring equitable distribution of wealth and resources, introduced two major lines of laws, one related to nationalization of banks and other related to derecognition of Privy Purses. The Supreme Court struck down both the moves of the parliament. Now the basic question had shifted as to the relative position of directive principles and the fundamental rights. This led to a political situation which the Indian history had never witnessed.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Judiciary and Parliament were at loggerhead in proving their supremacy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24<span class="s2">th</span> Constitutional Amendment Act – A step towards parliament’s Supremacy</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Any law that was incompatible with the Fundamental Rights was declared unConstitutional under Article 13. The Supreme Court concluded in Golak Nath that the term “law” covered Constitutional amendments; as a result, any Constitutional modification that infringed the Fundamental Rights was declared Unconstitutional. Modification under Amendment as follows-</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Nothing in this Article shall apply to <b>any amendment of this Constitution </b>made under</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Article 368<span class="p">,‘ according to a new clause (4) inserted to Article 13.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Article 368’s marginal header was changed from ‘<b>Procedure for amendment of the Constitution</b>’ to ‘<b>Power of Parliament to amend the Constitution and Procedure’</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">‘Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, Parliament may, in the exercise of its Constituent Power, amend by way of addition, variation, or repeal any provision of this Constitution in accordance with the procedure established forth in this Article,’ was added to <b>Article 368(1).</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">By changing the words ‘it shall be presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill and thereupon’ to <b>‘it shall be presented to the President for his assent and upon such assent being given to the Bill, </b>the President was made obligated to give assent to any Bill amending the Constitution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Article 368 was also given a reassuring clause (3), which said that “nothing in Article 13 shall</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">apply to any amendment <span class="p">made under this Article.”</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">The </span>Supreme Court recognized Basic Structure concept <a href="http://www.legalservicesindia.com/forum/topic109-kesavananda-bharati-vs-state-of-kerala-and-ors.html" style=" color: black; font-family:Calibri, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 14pt;" target="_blank">for the first time in the historic </a>Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973<span class="p">.

In this case validity of the <b>25th Amendment act was challenged along with the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-ninth Amendments</b>. The court by majority overruled the Golak Nath case which denied parliament the power to amend fundamental rights of the citizens.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The majority held that <b>article 368 even before the 24th Amendment contained the power as well as the procedure of amendment. </b>The Supreme Court declared that Article 368 did not enable Parliament to alter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution and parliament could <b>not use its amending powers under Article 368 </b>to &#39;damage&#39;, &#39;emasculate&#39;, &#39;destroy&#39;, &#39;abrogate&#39;, &#39;change&#39; or &#39;alter&#39; the &#39;basic structure&#39; or framework of the constitution.
