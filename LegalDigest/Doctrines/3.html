</style></head><body><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introduction</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">India has a federal form of government and has been a united country for over seven decades with power being divided between the Centre and the States on the account of federal structure of governance. Federal form of government has two or more levels of government. Each level of government has its own jurisdiction . The jurisdiction of the respective levels of government is specified in the <span style=" color: #000;">Constitution</span>. The main feature of federalism is the segregation of power between the Centre and the states. The fundamental provisions of the Constitution cannot be unilaterally changed by one level of government. Federal system has the objective to safeguard and promote unity and accommodate regional diversity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">There was consensus on power sharing even before independence. Leaders were aware of the regional and linguistic diversity. The Constituent Assembly decided to form a government that would be based on the principles of unity and cooperation between the Centre and the states which was to have constitutional status and a clearly identified area of activity. However, if a legislative body isn’t allowed to make laws in a particular area and does so anyway indirectly under the grab of another legislation, the doctrine of colourable legislation comes into play.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Colourable legislation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In order to prevent the misuse of power by anyone organ of the government, the Constitution says that each of these organs should exercise different powers. This develops a system of checks and balances. The Constitution has divided powers between the Centre and the states with their particular subject matters. But sometimes, the legislative body enacts legislation which falls outside its area of competence. This means that it has transgressed its powers and has indirectly done something which could not have been done directly. This is called colourable exercise of legislative power or indirectly making laws when</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">prohibited from doing so directly. So, to check the transgression of legislative authorities, the doctrine of colourable legislation came into existence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The colourable legislation also deals with such questions wherein one law is supposedly passed under the garb of another. Colourable legislation comes from a legal maxim- <b>“Quando aliquid prohibetur ex directo, prohibetur et per obliquum” </b>which means which is <b>prohibited directly is also prohibited indirectly</b>. It means when a legislature does not have the power to make laws on a particular subject directly, it cannot make laws on it indirectly. Colourable legislation is one of the doctrines under the Indian Constitution. It basically means coloured legislation which is not its true colour. So, whenever the Union or state encroaches their respective legislative competence and makes such laws, colourable legislation comes into the picture to determine legislative accountability of that law.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Division of Legislative power between Centre and States</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #000;">Article 246 of Constitution </span>is about subject matter legislation referring to who has power with regards to which subject matter to make laws. We know that the power has been distributed under <b>three lists. </b>The powers that Centre and States have been categorised by the <b>7th schedule </b>under 3 lists- <b>Union list (List I), State list (List II), Concurrent list (List III) </b>which is mentioned under <span style=" color: #000;">Article 246 of Constitution </span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The Union list incorporates areas which are of national importance like <b>defence, foreign affairs, currency, atomic energy and so forth</b>. It has a <b>total of 97 items </b>on which the Parliament has exclusive right to make laws. Similarly, those items are covered in State list which are of local importance like <b>trade, agriculture, police </b>etc. There are a <b>total of 61 items on which the State has exclusive powe</b>r to make laws. <b>Concurrent list contains 52 items </b>like <b>education, adulteration, adoption etc</b>.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Concerning the Union and State both and pertaining to which both can make laws. Another set of powers is residuary powers which include all other matters not mentioned in any of the lists like cyber laws. The States and Union are both required to operate within their respective legislative competence. Even though a colour is given to the law for bringing it under competency it would be declared as void. Colourable legislation emerges whenever the legislative bodies had <b>no power to create laws on an item because </b>either it was not included in the list as per Schedule 7 or for the limitations of Part III (Fundamental Right) of the Constitution or any other provision of the Constitution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Concerns and limitation on the application of the Doctrine of Colourable legislation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The doctrine does not apply to subordinate legislation. It is based only on the question of “<b>competency of a particular legislative body” </b>to enact a particular law. The presumption is always in <b>favour of the constitutionality of the law </b>and the burden is on the person who wants to show that there has been a clear violation of constitutional principles. Whoever is taking any new law to the court and claiming that to be a colourable legislation, he has to <b>prove how the law is a colourable legislation</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">It has no application where there is no constitutional limitation and where powers of a legislature are not bound by any limitation. For example, there will be no application of colourable legislation if such power works only according to the Constitution. The legislation is not actionable for extraneous consideration.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The doctrine is not related to <b>bona fide or mala fide intention </b>of the legislature. It only sees whether the enacted law is under the competency of the legislature or not. It is not concerned about whether the law is relevant or irrelevant. If there is an absence of competency, then the relevance of motive is dead. Thus, the constitutionality of the statute is completely a question of legislative competency.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <b>K.C. Gajapati Narayana Deo v. State of Orissa, AIR 1953 </b>supreme court explained the doctrine of colourable legislation…. “If the constitution of a State distributes the legislative powers amongst different bodies, <b>which have to act within their respective </b>spheres marked out by specific legislative entries... questions do arise as to whether the legislature in a particular case has or has not, in respect to the subject matter of the statute or in the method of enacting it, transgressed the limits of its constitutional powers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Such transgression may be <b>patent, manifest or direct</b>, but it may also be disguised, covert or indirect, and it is to this latter class of cases that the expression colourable legislation has been applied... The idea conveyed by the expression is that although apparently a legislature in passing a statute purported to act within the limits of its powers, yet, in substance and in reality it transgressed these powers, the transgression being veiled by</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">what appears, on proper examination, to be mere pretence or disguise.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>R.S. Joshi v. Ajit Mills, Ahmedabad, AIR 1977, </b>“In the jurisprudence of power, colourable exercise of or fraud on legislative power or, more frightfully, fraud on the Constitution, are expressions which merely mean that the legislature is incompetent to <b>enact a particular law, although the label of competency </b>is stuck on it, and then it is colourable legislation. It is very important to notice that if the legislature is competent to pass the particular law, the motives which impel it to pass the law are really irrelevant…. if a legislation, apparently enacted under one Entry in the List, falls I plain truth and fact, within the content, not of that Entry but of one assigned to another legislature, it can be struck down as colourable even if the motives were most commendable.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In <span style=" color: #000;">Naga People’s Movement for Human Rights v. Union of India, AIR 1998, </span><span class="s2">the Supreme Court rejecting the argument that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, enacted by Parliament is colourable legislation and a fraud on the Constitution, has observed in this</span></h1><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">connection, “<b>The use of the expression ‘colourable legislation’ seeks to convey that by enacting the legislation in question the legislature is seeking to do indirectly what it cannot do directly</b>. But ultimately the issue boils down to the question whether the legislature had the competence to enact the legislation because if the impugned legislation falls within the competence of the legislature the question of doing something indirectly</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">which cannot be done directly does not arise”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">It is rare that a law is declared bad on the ground of colourable legislation. As per <b>State of Bihar v. Kameshwar, AIR 1952</b>, A State law dealing with the abolition of the landlord system, provided for payment of compensation on the basis of income accruing to the landlord by way of rent. Arrears of the rent due to the landlord prior to the date of acquisition were to vest in the State, and half of these arrears were to be given to the landlord as compensation. The provision was held to be a piece of colourable legislation and hence void.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per <b>S. Sat Pal &amp; Co. v. Lt. Gov. of Delhi, AIR 1979, </b>If a statute is found to be invalid on the ground of legislative competence, it does not permanently inhibit the legislature from re-enacting the same if the power to do so is properly traced and established. In such a situation, it cannot be said that the subsequent legislation is merely a colourable legislation or a camouflage to re-enact the invalidated previous legislation.</p></body></html>
