      The Court observed as Equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one
      belongs to the Rule of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and
      caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary it is implicit
      in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and
      constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14, and if it
      affects any matter relating to public employment, it is also violative of
      Article 16. Articles 14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in State action and
      ensure fairness and equality of treatment.”

      In this period the doctrine of precedent was completely overlooked. Each
      successive decision were counterproductive without any legitimate basis.
      Starting with the McDowell case Reddy J. delivering on behalf of 3 judge
      bench of supreme court, overlooked larger bench decisions on the point
      (Ajay Hasia in particular) as stated in Shayara Bano case, “Mcdowell
      itself is per incuriam, not having noticed several judgments of Benches of
      equal or higher strength, its reasoning even otherwise being flawed. The
      judgments, following McDowell are, therefore, no longer good law.”

      It described <b>‘manifest arbitrariness’ </b>as “Under Article 14 the test
      of manifest arbitrariness, therefore,
      <b
        >must be something done by the legislature capriciously, irrationally
        and/or without adequate determining principle</b
      >. Also, when something is done which is excessive and disproportionate,
      such legislation would be manifestly arbitrary. We are, therefore, of the
      view that arbitrariness in the sense of manifest arbitrariness as pointed
      out by us above would apply to negate legislation as well Under Article
      14.”

      Talaq-e-biddat drives its legal force
      <b>from Section 2 of Shariat Act,1937 </b>which is the ‘law in force’. And
      such law being manifestly arbitrary was struck down as violating Art 14 of
      the constitution This form of Talaq must, therefore, be held to be
      violative of the fundamental right contained Under Article 14 of the
      Constitution of India. In our opinion, therefore, the 1937 Act, insofar as
      it seeks to recognize and enforce Triple Talaq, is within the meaning of
      the expression &quot;laws in force&quot; in Article 13(1) and must be
      struck down as being void to the extent that it recognizes and enforces
      Triple Talaq.
