      Doctrine of eclipse means that &quot;A law which is in violation of
      fundamental rights of human will be dormant until necessary amendment is
      made to the law in such a way that it should not violate fundamental
      rights of human.&quot; On general it means that the fundamental rights of
      human are more important than any laws. The doctrine of eclipse is based
      on the principle that a law which violates Fundamental Rights is not
      nullity or void ab initio but becomes only unenforceable, that is remains
      in a moribund condition.

      Therefore, the law in question will be regarded as having been ‘eclipsed’
      for the time being by the relevant Fundamental Right. It was in a dormant
      or moribund condition for the time being. Such a law was not dead for all
      purposes. If the relevant Fundamental Right is amended then the effect
      would be “to remove the shadow and to make the impugned Act free from all
      blemish or infirmity”. The law would then cease to be unconstitutional and
      become revivified and enforceable. <b>(See Purshottam v. Desai, 1956).</b>

      The doctrine of eclipse has been held to apply only to the
      pre-Constitution and not to the post-Constitution laws. The reason is that
      while a pre-Constitution law was valid when enacted and, therefore, was
      not void ab initio, but its voidity supervened when the Constitution came
      into force, a post-Constitution law infringing a Fundamental Right is
      unconstitutional and a nullity from its very inception. Therefore, it
      cannot be vitalised by a subsequent amendment of the Constitution removing
      the infirmity in the way of passing the law.

      And phrase under clause 2 of Article 13
      <b>“the State shall not make any law” </b>indicate that after the
      commencement of the Constitution, no law can be made so as to contravene a
      Fundamental Right. Such a law is void ab initio. Therefore, the doctrine
      of eclipse cannot apply to such a law and it cannot revive even if the
      relevant Fundamental Right is amended later to remove the hurdle in the
      way of such a law. (<b>See Saghir v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1954</b>).

      Subsequently in <b>State of Gujarat v. Ambica Mills, 1974 </b>the court
      modified its view The court held that post-constitutional laws, which are
      inconsistent with fundamental rights, are not void ab initio for all
      purposes. Void under <b>Article 13(2) </b>means void against persons whose
      fundamental right has been taken away. If a post-constitutional law takes
      away right conferred by Article 19 then such law will be void only with
      respect to citizens because rights under Article 19 are given only to
      citizens. Such law will validly operate with respect to non-citizens.
      Since such laws are not void ab intio for all purposes the
      <b>doctrine of eclipse </b>can be applied to post-constitutional laws as
      well.

      In other words, the court held that if the law contravenes fundamental
      right which is limited to citizens only, it will continue to operate with
      respect to non-citizens. Court clearly held that such law cannot be
      revived with respect to citizens merely by an amendment of fundamental
      right. It is because
      <b>Article 13(2) affects the competency of legislature </b>to enact laws
      which takes away fundamental rights. It means that the law will have to be
      re-enacted after the amendment of fundamental right if it is desired to
      make it operative.

      However, Supreme Court in
      <b>L. Jagannath v. Authorized Officer, 1972 </b>held that if an Act is
      declared unconstitutional on the pretext of Article 13(2), it can be
      revived only when it is put in Ninth Schedule because Article 31B cures
      the defect of the Act with retrospective effect.
