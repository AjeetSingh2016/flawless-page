Repugnancy arises when the provisions of two laws are so inconsistent and irreconcilable that it is impossible to do one without disobeying the other. <b>Part XI of the Indian Constitution </b>describes the legislative relations between the Centre and the States.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The legislative fields of the Parliament and the State Legislatures have been specified in <b>Article 246 of the Constitution </b>whereas <b>Article 254 </b>of the Indian Constitution describes the <b>mechanism of the resolution </b>of the <b>conflict between the Central and the State </b>Legislation enacted with respect to any matter enumerated in List III of the Seventh Schedule.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Repugnancy emerges when the arrangement of two laws are so conflicting and beyond reconciliation that it is difficult to do one without ignoring the other. In the Indian setting, in the event that such a contention emerges between a focal and state enactment, at that point the focal law will win. This has been expressed in <b>Article 254 of the Indian Constitution </b>and furthermore been additionally explained by the Supreme Court in different cases like repugnancy emerge and how it tends to be tackled, by referring to points of reference. <b>I.T.C Ltd. v. Agricultural Produce Market Committee, 2001 </b>the law-making power between the Union Parliament and State Legislatures in terms of various Articles read with Schedule VII. It further provides <b>List I </b>being the fields allocated for the <b>Parliament</b>, <b>List II </b>being those within the exclusive domain of the <b>State Legislatures </b>and <b>List III </b>represents those areas where both carry <b>concurrent powers to make laws</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The Indian Constitution through <b>Article 254 provides that a law on a subject-matter </b>prescribed in List III enacted by the State Legislature would be valid only in case, where it is <b>not in contravention to a law made by the Parliament </b>on the same subject-matter. Thus in order to put more light and certainty the Doctrine of Repugnancy came in to picture as a</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">principle, which is employed so as to ascertain when and where a State law turns repugnant to the Parliamentary legislation. For the matters in the Concurrent list, both the Centre and the State has the power to make laws. They both have <b>equal authority to come up with legislation (under Concurrent list)</b>. But, the laws made by the Centre for the same matters as the State shall prevail. Article 254 of the Indian Constitution enumerates the concept of <b>doctrine of repugnancy</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In <b>ITC Ltd. v. Agricultural Produce Market Committee </b>the Supreme Court found a direct inconsistency between an Act enumerated by the Centre and an Act enacted by the State. So, the Court held that there is no chance of allowing the functioning of both the laws. In the given instance, the law made by the Centre prevails over the law made by the State.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Rule of occupied Field</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In <b>Bhikaji v. State of Madhya Pradesh </b>the Court mentioned that just because the legislature enacted is repugnant in nature, it does not make the entire part invalid and in case if the laws made by the Centre are repealed at any point of time, it would become operative at a later stage. If the Parliament tries to be overpowering and enacts law that covers the entire field, then it is called as the <b>Rule of occupied field.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When laws are complimentary to each other not repugnant</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In <b>M. Karunanidhi v. Union of India </b>the Centre and the State made laws on the same subject matter were discovered to be complimentary but not conflicting. So the Hon’ble Supreme Court held in this case that the laws enacted by both the Centre and the State could co-exist by not colliding or overlapping with each other.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The <b>non - obstante clause of Article 246 </b>is the last resort available and it is utilized in circumstances of irreconcilable conflicts. The court shall consider all the possible attempts to interpret the entries so as to settle the repugnancy and overlapping. The application of liberal</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">and <b>harmonious construction </b>requires conflicting entries and the intent of conflicting entries are kept by the Court to give a compatible solution for the concerned situation</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">In <b>Ujagar Prints v. Union of India </b>the Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in declining the validity of law questioned on the ground of legislative competence, the State can always show that the law was supportable under any other entry that is within the competency.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The words in the <b>‘Concurrent list’ </b>seemed to qualify only the <b>‘present’ </b>law that means that the prevailing law in relation to a matter in the Concurrent List triumphs over a State law in the <b>particular area in case of inconsistency</b>. So, if there is repugnancy between a State law and Central law filling in the respective lists, then the latter should prevail over the former. However, the judicial interpretation of the Article 254(1) has so far been otherwise.</p></body></html>
