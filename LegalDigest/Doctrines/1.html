Thus the doctrine of adverse possession served to clear the title to real property.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Much of Indian law has its roots in English law and the doctrine of Adverse Possession is no exemption. For the first time the limitations for these type of Suits was prescribed in English laws as Twenty (20) years with the passage of time, where under the Indian law which incorporated the <b>doctrine of Adverse Possession </b>the period of limitation for the same is also prescribed by the <b>Limitation Act, 1963.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Position of Doctrine in Indian Context:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In India the concept of Adverse Possession mean that a trespasser or a stranger who comes into possession of the land must be in exclusive and continuous possession and without interruption for a certain period of time <b>typically 12 to 30 consecutive years depending upon the classification of ownership </b>(i.e, Private or Government) of the land. That the statute of Limitations is intended to give true owners ample time to check on and protect their property from adverse claim. If the true owners fail to do that for a protracted period, he is bound to loose the land.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The law of Adverse Possession is contained in the Article 65 Sch-I of the Limitation Act, 1963 which prescribes a limitation of 12 years for a suit for possession of an immovable property or any interest therein based on title.</h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The Limitation Act 1963 is a key piece of legislation elaborating on adverse possession. Under <b>Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963 no cognizance can be taken by the Court if the suit is barred by limitation whether defence taken by the defendant or not, however, it is to be noted that the said provision bars only the remedy of the person filing the suit and not his right as available to him under law.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">However there is an exception regarding extinguishment of right under the Limitation Act, 1963 as provided under <b>Section 27 which provides that in case the person has not taken any action for recovery of possession during the period of limitation then his rights get extinguished</b>. So in a situation where a person does not take any action for recovery of possession of land within a period of twelve years as provided under Article 65 in Schedule I of the Limitation Act, 1963 his rights get extinguished and therefore the land is left in abeyance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">But the law of adverse possession is based upon the principle that a land cannot be left in abeyance for a long time as already stated above. Hence someone has to be the owner of the land when the rightful owner has lost his rights once failed to take action as provided Section 27 of the Limitation Act. So, in the said situation the person is adverse possession of the land becomes the rightful and absolute owner of the land as per Article 65. It also has to be kept in mind that limitation period of twelve years starts only when the possession has become adverse to the true owner and not otherwise.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Judgment of privy council upheld by Hon’ble supreme court</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The concept of adverse possession has been well settled by the judicial committee of the Privy Council in 1907 in <b>Perry v Clissold (1907) </b>wherein it was held :</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">&quot;It cannot be disputed that a person in possession of land in the assumed character of owner and exercising peaceably the ordinary rights of ownership has a perfectly good title against all the world but the rightful owner. And if the <b>rightful owner does not come forward and assert his title by the process of law within the period prescribed by the provisions of the statute of Limitation applicable to the case, his right is forever extinguished </b>and the possessory owner acquires an absolute title. &quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The decisions of the Privy Council though not binding on the Supreme Court but still the said decision was upheld by three judges of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of <b>Nair Service Society v K.C. Alexander</b>, 1968 . Thus it can be said that till date it is a good law, that if a person in hostile possession of the land though not being the true owner, becomes the absolute owner if the rightful owner of the said land does not come forward within the statutory period of <b>twelve years as provided under the Limitation Act, 1963</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are the prerequisite to claim Adverse Possession</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Actual possession of Property: <span class="p">Adverse possession consists of actual occupation of the land with the intent to keep it solely for oneself. Merely claiming the land or paying taxes on it, without actually possessing it, is insufficient. Entry on the land, whether legal or not, is essential. A trespass may commence adverse possession, but there must be more than temporary use of the property by a trespasser for adverse possession to be established.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Physical acts must show that the possessor is exercising the dominion over the land that an average Ordinary use of the property—for example, planting and harvesting crops or cutting and selling timber—indicates actual possession.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Such possession should be open and notorious to the use of the property: <span class="p">An adverse possessor must possess land openly for the entire world to See, as a true owner would. Secretly occupying anothers lands does not give the occupant any legal</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">rights. Clearing, fencing, cultivating, or improving the land demonstrates open and notorious possession, while actual residence on the land is the most open and notorious possession of all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The owner must have actual knowledge of the adverse use, or the claimant’s possession must be so notorious that it is generally known by the public or the people in the neighborhood. The notoriety of the possession puts the owner on notice that the land will be lost unless he or she seeks to recover possession of it within a certain time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Exclusive possession and use of the property<span class="p">: Adverse possession will not ripen into title unless the claimant has had exclusive possession of the land. Exclusive possession means sole physical occupancy. The claimant must hold the property as his or her own, in opposition to the claims of all others. Physical improvement of the land, as by the construction of fences or houses, is evidence of exclusive possession.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Such possession should be hostile or adverse to the true owner: <span class="p">Possession must be hostile, sometimes called adverse, if title is to mature from adverse possession. Hostile possession means that the claimant must occupy the land in opposition to the true owner’s rights. One type of hostile possession occurs when the claimant enters and remains on land under color of title.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Color of title is the appearance of title as a result of a deed that seems by its language to give the claimant valid title but, in fact, does not because some aspect of it is defective. If a person, for example, was suffering from a legal disability at the time he or she executed a deed, the grantee-claimant does not receive actual title. But the grantee-claimant does have color of title because it would appear to anyone reading the deed that good title had been conveyed. If a claimant possesses the land in the manner required by law for the full statutory period, his or her color of title will become actual title as a result of adverse possession.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As per Limitation Act, 1963, if a plaintiff establishes his title, he is entitled to recover possession<b>. The burden to prove perfection of title by adverse possession rests upon defendant who raises such a plea </b>in <b>Thota Kameswara Rao Vs. Thota Ramgopal, 2015 </b>. The person who pleads adverse possession must not only prove the factum of continuous possession for over 12 years but also prove that such possession was open and adverse to the actual owner.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="5."><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Possession must be with intention of ouster of the real owner <span class="p">:- Animus possidendi necessary. </span>Possession does not become adverse when the intention to hold adversely is wanting<span class="p">. Person holding property by way of adverse possession must publish his intention to deny right of the real owner. His intention of adverse possession must be within notice, knowledge of the real owner. If there are circumstances showing open and notorious act of taking possession, knowledge may be presumed.

In dispossession a person comes in, and drives out another from possession. In discontinuance of possession, the person in possession goes out and is followed into possession by others.

Acts between neighbours, occasional acts of interference which are naturally explained by the desire of the person doing them to protect their own property do not amount to dispossession.</p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Possession of another essential for dispossession<span class="p">: Dispossession implies the coming in of a person and driving out of another person from possession. Dispossession implies ouster and the essence of ouster is that the person ousting is in actual possession of the property.
