By applying <b>Extra Territorial operation laws </b>the business of British India widely spread in Extra- Territorial Boundaries and this Act of 1935 was applied to India for huge profit of British India.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">After Independence, discussion about Extra Territorial operation was made in constitution. Indian Constitution <b>follows principle of federalism and made division of legislative power </b>into two categories <b>first with respect to territory </b>and <b>second with respect to subject matter </b>concerned and as per Article 245 of the Indian Constitution, Parliament can make laws for any part of territory of India and for whole, legislature of state can make laws for whole or any part of state and also states that the law made, the act of parliament shall not be declared unlawful solely because of extra-territorial operations, although there is no</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">mention of the states’ extraterritorial operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Hence <b>Doctrine of Territorial Nexus </b>is originated by the state government of India from interpretation of Apex court for the state’s Extra-territorial operations. The doctrine of territorial nexus states that a law passed by a state legislature applies exclusively within that state and is <b>not applicable in extra-territorial operations </b>unless there is a sufficient <b>link between the object and the state.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Supreme Court made a significant observation and states that in assessment of tax the doctrine of territorial Nexus plays very important role.
