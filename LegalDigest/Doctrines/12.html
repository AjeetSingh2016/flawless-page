      In case (<b>R.M.D.C. v. Union of India, 1957</b>) Supreme Court explained
      this doctrine “When a legislature whose authority is subject to
      limitations aforesaid enacts a law which is wholly in
      <b
        >excess of its powers, it is entirely void and must be completely
        ignored</b
      >. But when the legislation falls in part within the area allotted to it
      and in part outside it, it is undoubtedly void as to the latter; but does
      it on that become necessarily void in its entirety? The answer to this
      question must depend on whether
      <b>what is valid could be separated from what is invalid</b>, and that is
      a question which has to be decided by the Court on a consideration of the provisions of the Act”.

      As per
      <b>Smt. Brij Rajkumari And Anr. vs Raja Mohammad Mustafa Ali Khan, 1967</b
      >, Allahbad High court The doctrine of severability rests, as will
      presently be shown, on a presumed intention of the Legislature that
      <b>if a part of a statute turns out to be void</b>, that should not affect the validity of the rest of it, and that that intention is to be
      ascertained from the terms of the statute.

       It is the true nature of the
      subject-matter of the legislation that is the determining factor, and,
      while a classification made in the statute might go far to support a
      conclusion in favour of severability, the absence of it does not
      necessarily preclude if.&quot;

      In <b>R.S. Jiwani v. Ircon </b>, the Division bench found that the
      <b>doctrine of severability </b>did indeed apply to arbitral awards. The
      test for its application was, simply enough, whether
      <b>the relevant part of the award was severable</b>. The Court noted: The
      cases would be different where it is not possible or permissible to sever
      the award. In other words, where the bad part of the award was
      intermingled and interdependent upon the good part of the award there it
      is practically not possible to sever the award as the illegality may
      affect the award as a whole. In such cases, it may not be possible to set
      aside the award partially.

      It appears that it is difficult to evolve a clear-cut principle as
      <b>much depends on the facts of each case</b>, the determining factor
      being whether, on the provision being sustained to the extent it falls
      within the permissible limits, is there any danger of its being misused
      for the purpose not permitted ? If the Court has the ultimate control to
      decide whether a particular  application of the law goes beyond the permissible limits, then there may
      not be any danger of misuse of the provision.

      If, however, the matter has
      been left to the subjective satisfaction of the Executive, and the Court
      cannot scrutinize the basis of such satisfaction to see whether the law
      has been applied to a purpose not permitted, then it will be safer to
      declare the whole provision bad.
